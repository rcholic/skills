China is a proscribed destination under ITAR § 126.1(d)(1) — exports of USML Category XI technical data to China require a licence (which is almost certainly denied under the policy of denial for China). The violation is: unauthorised export of defence articles (technical data) to a Chinese national without a DDTC licence. This is a per se violation regardless of the engineer's intent or connections — ITAR is a strict liability regime for deemed exports.

(4) A VSD does not guarantee no penalty, but it almost always results in a significantly reduced outcome — typically a consent agreement with administrative requirements rather than a maximum civil penalty.

(3) Audit ALL 35 foreign nationals' access to ITAR-controlled information — determine if any others have unauthorised access. (4) Implement a Technology Control Plan (TCP) that includes: physical access controls (badge readers on ITAR work areas), IT access controls (role-based access to classified data repositories), mandatory foreign national screening before ITAR project assignment, annual ITAR training for all employees, and FSO quarterly access reviews.
