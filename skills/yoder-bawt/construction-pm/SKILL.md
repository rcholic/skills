# Construction PM

Production-tested construction project management toolkit. Built from real roofing company workflows managing 36+ active jobs and $1.8M+ pipeline.

## When to Activate

Use Construction PM when:
1. **Tracking jobs** through the full lifecycle (lead → estimate → sold → permitted → scheduled → in-progress → complete → invoiced → paid)
2. **Generating daily briefings** for project managers on job status and pipeline health
3. **Checking permits** - identifying permits pending longer than threshold days
4. **Parsing emails** from field staff for job status updates
5. **Monitoring pipeline revenue** across all job statuses to forecast cash flow

## Guardrails / Anti-Patterns

**DO:**
- ✓ Initialize the database with `init.sh` before using other commands
- ✓ Use consistent job numbers that match your accounting/CRM system
- ✓ Update job status promptly when conditions change
- ✓ Run daily briefings to catch stale jobs before they fall through cracks
- ✓ Set permit-check thresholds appropriate for your jurisdiction (14-30 days typical)

**DON'T:**
- ✗ Delete job history - status changes are append-only audit trail
- ✗ Skip the stale check - jobs without updates often indicate problems
- ✗ Use generic customer names - be specific for searchability
- ✗ Forget to set permit numbers when available - they're required for inspections
- ✗ Mix currency formats - use plain integers (49000 not $49,000 or 49k)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize the job tracker (creates JSON database)
bash scripts/init.sh

# Or specify a custom data directory
DATA_DIR=/path/to/data bash scripts/init.sh
```

Default data location: `construction-pm-data/` in your workspace.

## Job Pipeline

### Add a job
```bash
bash scripts/add-job.sh \
  --number "12043" \
  --customer "Nichols" \
  --address "123 Main St" \
  --pm "Greg" \
  --value 49000 \
  --status "permitted" \
  --permit-status "approved" \
  --notes "Roof replacement, 30sq"
```

### Update job status
```bash
bash scripts/add-job.sh --number "12043" --status "in-progress" --notes "Crew on site Monday"
```

### View pipeline
```bash
# All jobs
bash scripts/pipeline.sh

# Filter by status
bash scripts/pipeline.sh --status permitted

# Filter by PM
bash scripts/pipeline.sh --pm Greg

# Stale jobs (no update in 14+ days)
bash scripts/pipeline.sh --stale 14

# Summary stats
bash scripts/pipeline.sh --summary
```

## Daily Briefing

```bash
# Generate today's briefing
bash scripts/briefing.sh

# Custom stale threshold
bash scripts/briefing.sh --stale-days 7

# Output to file
bash scripts/briefing.sh > /path/to/briefing.md
```

The briefing includes:
- Jobs starting this week
- Permits pending > 7 days
- Stale jobs (no update in 14+ days)
- Pipeline summary by status
- Revenue at each stage

## Permit Tracking

```bash
# Check all pending permits
bash scripts/permit-check.sh

# Flag permits older than N days
bash scripts/permit-check.sh --threshold 30
```

## Email Parsing

```bash
# Parse a PM email for job updates
bash scripts/parse-email.sh --file /path/to/email.txt

# Parse from stdin
echo "Job 12043 Nichols - permit approved, scheduling crew for next week" | bash scripts/parse-email.sh
```

Extracts: job numbers, customer names, status keywords, permit mentions, dates.

## Job Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lead` | Initial inquiry, not yet estimated |
| `estimate` | Estimate sent, waiting for approval |
| `sold` | Contract signed, not yet permitted |
| `permitted` | Permits approved, ready to schedule |
| `scheduled` | Crew and materials scheduled |
| `in-progress` | Work underway |
| `complete` | Work done, pending final inspection |
| `invoiced` | Invoice sent |
| `paid` | Payment received |
| `on-hold` | Paused for any reason |
| `cancelled` | Job cancelled |

## Data Format

Jobs are stored as JSON in `construction-pm-data/jobs.json`:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "number": "12043",
      "customer": "Nichols",
      "address": "123 Main St",
      "pm": "Greg",
      "value": 49000,
      "status": "permitted",
      "permit_status": "approved",
      "permit_number": "",
      "notes": "Roof replacement, 30sq",
      "created": "2026-02-08",

      "history": [
        {"date": "2026-02-08", "from": "", "to": "permitted", "note": "Initial entry"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
