# Voice Extractor

Here's the thing about AI-generated content: it all sounds the same.

Generic. Safe. Forgettable.

The fix isn't better prompts. It's teaching the AI how YOU actually communicate.

That's what this skill does. You give it writing samples, it gives you back a Voice Guide — your communication DNA, documented and ready to use.

**Why this matters:** Once you have a Voice Guide, every piece of AI output sounds like you. Not like ChatGPT. Not like every other founder on LinkedIn. *You.*

## What You Need to Start

Get me 3-5 writing samples. More is better. Could be:
- Emails you've sent
- LinkedIn posts
- Articles or blog posts
- Transcripts of you speaking (podcasts, calls)
- Slack messages (often more authentic than polished writing)

The messier and more authentic, the better. Transcripts of you talking are gold — that's where your real voice lives.

Also tell me:
- What's this voice guide for? (AI training, ghostwriter, team alignment)
- Any topics where you want to sound MORE confident vs. more exploratory?

## How I Extract Your Voice

### Step 1: Find Your Core Energy

Every person has a natural communication mode. I'm looking for:

**What role do you naturally play?**
- The teacher who breaks things down?
- The challenger who pushes back?
- The cheerleader who builds confidence?
- The straight-shooter who cuts through BS?

**What's your default energy?**
- Calm authority ("Here's what works")
- High enthusiasm ("This is exciting, let me show you")
- Understated confidence ("I've seen this a hundred times")

**What do you actually care about?**
I'll look for themes that repeat across your samples. The stuff you can't help but talk about.

---

### Step 2: Steal Your Phrases

This is where it gets specific. I'm hunting for:

**Your transition phrases** — How do you shift topics?
- "Here's the thing..."
- "What I've learned is..."
- "Let me put it this way..."

**Your emphasis phrases** — How do you land a point?
- "The reality is..."
- "What that actually means..."
- "This is the part people miss..."

**Your closers** — How do you wrap up?
- "That's the move."
- "Start there."
- "You've got this."

These become the cheat codes for anyone (or any AI) writing as you.

### Step 3: Map Your Confidence Zones

Not every topic deserves the same energy. I'll figure out:

**Where you're an expert** (write with full authority):
- Zero hedging
- "Here's what works" energy
- Definitive statements

**Where you're experienced but not the expert** (write with earned opinion):
- "What I've found..."
- "In my experience..."
- Still confident, just not absolute

**Where you're actively learning** (write with curiosity):
- "What I'm seeing..."
- "I'm testing this right now..."
- Excited but exploratory

This calibration is what makes the voice feel real, not like a one-note character.

### Step 4: Document the Anti-Patterns

Just as important as what you DO say is what you'd NEVER say.

I'll identify:
- Words that would feel wrong coming from you
- Phrases that make you cringe
- Tones you avoid
- Jargon you hate (even industry-standard jargon)

**Example from my own voice guide:**
- Never use "synergy" or "leverage" as verbs
- Avoid hedging words like "maybe" or "possibly"
- Don't start sentences with "So," when writing (fine when talking)
- Cut "I think" — just say the thing

## How to Use the Voice Guide

**For AI training:** Paste the Voice Guide into your system prompt. Every output gets filtered through your style.

**For ghostwriters:** Hand it over on day one. Cuts revision cycles in half.

**For your team:** Now everyone knows what "on brand" actually sounds like.

**For yourself:** When you're stuck, read it. It reminds you how you actually communicate when you're not overthinking it.

## The 10-Minute Version

Short on time? I can do a quick extraction:

1. Read 3 samples fast
2. Pull 10 signature phrases
3. Note 3 things you'd never say
4. One sentence describing your energy

That's a minimum viable voice guide. Better than nothing by a mile.

---

## Real Talk

The best voice guides come from messy, authentic content. Not your polished website copy — the email you fired off at 11pm. Not the edited article — the podcast where you riffed for an hour.

Give me the real stuff. I'll find the patterns.
