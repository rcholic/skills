## PARA Method Explained

### Projects (1-projects/)
**Definition:** A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.

**Examples:**
- Complete website redesign (due March 1)
- Plan vacation to Japan (departing April 15)
- Launch product feature (Q2 goal)

**When to move to archives:** When completed or cancelled.

### Areas (2-areas/)
**Definition:** A sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.

**Examples:**
- Health & Fitness
- Personal Finance
- Professional Development
- Relationships
- Home Maintenance

**When to move to archives:** When no longer relevant to your life.

### Resources (3-resources/)
**Definition:** A topic or theme of ongoing interest.

**Examples:**
- Gardening tips
- Python programming
- Travel destinations
- Recipes
- Book notes

**When to move to archives:** When no longer interested.

### Archives (4-archives/)
**Definition:** Inactive items from the other three categories.

**Purpose:** Keep out of sight but accessible for reference.

## Proactive Agent Architecture Explained

### Core Files

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `SOUL.md` | Who the agent is, principles, boundaries | When identity evolves |
| `USER.md` | Who you are, your goals and preferences | As you share more context |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operating rules and workflows | When patterns emerge |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool configurations and notes | When learning tool usage |
| `SESSION-STATE.md` | Current task and context | Continuously (WAL protocol) |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic check checklist | Review regularly |
| `MEMORY.md` | Curated long-term wisdom | Periodically distill |

### Memory System

**Three-tier memory:**
1. **SESSION-STATE.md** - Active working memory (current session)
2. **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** - Daily raw logs
3. **MEMORY.md** - Curated long-term wisdom

**WAL Protocol (Write-Ahead Logging):**
- Corrections → Write immediately
- Decisions → Write immediately
- Names/Preferences → Write immediately
- Specific values → Write immediately

**Working Buffer:**
- Activates at 60% context usage
- Captures every exchange
- Survives context compaction

## Usage Workflows

### Daily Workflow
1. **Capture** → Drop files into `+inbox/`
2. **Process** → Sort inbox into PARA folders
3. **Work** → Create/update projects
4. **Log** → Agent writes to `memory/`

### Weekly Review
1. Clear `+inbox/` and `+temp/`
2. Review `2-areas/` for maintenance
3. Archive completed projects
4. Check `.learnings/` for patterns

### Monthly Review
1. Clean `4-archives/`
2. Review `3-resources/` for relevance
3. Update `MEMORY.md` with distilled learnings

## Integration Points

### PARA ↔ Proactive Agent

| PARA | Proactive Agent | Integration |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Project notes | `1-projects/X/notes.md` | Agent can read/write |
| Decisions | `SESSION-STATE.md` | WAL protocol captures |
| Daily work | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Automatic logging |
| Learnings | `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` | Error/learning capture |
| Archives | `4-archives/` | Completed projects |

## Best Practices

### For You (Human)
- Process `+inbox/` weekly (Inbox Zero)
- Keep `+temp/` clean daily
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Review areas monthly

### For Your Agent
- Read `SOUL.md` + `USER.md` on startup
- Use WAL protocol for critical details
- Log errors to `.learnings/ERRORS.md`
- Review `HEARTBEAT.md` periodically
