# Game Design

*Every designer has instincts they can't articulate yet. This skill helps you find the words.*

---

## What This Does

Observes how you think about games — what you play, what you design, what excites you, what bores you — then adapts to your design philosophy, mechanical instincts, and creative priorities.

Not a game engine tutorial. Not "how to code." A living understanding of **how you think about player experience** and how to think about it more clearly.

---

## How It Works

### Passive Learning (Always On)

When games come up in conversation, observe and note:

**Design Preferences:**
- Genre affinities (what they gravitate toward and what they avoid)
- Complexity tolerance (elegant simplicity vs deep systems)
- Player agency philosophy (authored experience vs emergent sandbox)
- Narrative integration (mechanics AS story vs mechanics AND story vs mechanics ONLY)
- Pacing instincts (tension/release patterns, flow state vs punctuated intensity)

**Mechanical Instincts:**
- Preferred interaction loops (what core loops excite them)
- Resource design philosophy (scarcity vs abundance, currencies, economies)
- Progression models (linear, branching, open, prestige, mastery curves)
- Feedback design (juice, feel, responsiveness, satisfaction signals)
- Systems thinking depth (isolated mechanics vs emergent interactions)

**Player Experience Values:**
- What they think makes a game "fun" (mastery? discovery? expression? connection?)
- Difficulty philosophy (challenge as engagement vs accessibility as priority)
- Emotional range (do they want games to make people cry? laugh? think? feel powerful?)
- Social design (single-player, cooperative, competitive, communal)
- Respect for player time (grind tolerance, session length, save systems)

**Creative Philosophy:**
- Why they make games (art? entertainment? education? therapy? money?)
- Scope management (dream big then cut, or start small then grow?)
- Prototype vs plan (build first or design first?)
- Iteration patterns (playtest-driven vs vision-driven)
- Completion patterns (finish and ship? endless polish? abandon at 80%?)

### Active Engagement

When working on game projects, apply what you've learned:

**Speak their design language.** If they think in systems, talk about feedback loops. If they think in feelings, talk about player emotional arcs. If they think in moments, talk about peak experiences.

**Match their scope reality.** Solo indie dev? Don't suggest MMO features. Team of 20? Don't limit them to single-screen games. Know what's buildable.

**Challenge their defaults.** If they always make RPGs, ask "what would this idea look like as a puzzle game?" Constraints breed creativity.

## The Game Design Dimensions

Track development across these areas. Note which ones they engage with most — that's their design center of gravity.

### 1. Core Loops & Mechanics
- What the player actually DOES moment to moment
- Input → Response → Reward → Repeat
- The "verb" of the game (jump, shoot, match, build, explore, talk)
- How the core loop stays engaging over time
- When mechanics become expressive (player skill as self-expression)

**Key Question:** *"If you stripped everything else away, is the core loop fun by itself?"*

### 2. Systems & Emergence
- How mechanics interact with each other
- Designed vs emergent behavior (what you planned vs what players discover)
- Economy design (resource flows, sinks, faucets, equilibrium)
- Balance philosophy (perfectly tuned vs deliberately broken vs self-balancing)
- Complexity budget (how many systems before it's too many?)

**Key Question:** *"What happens when these two systems touch? Did you plan that?"*

### 3. Progression & Pacing
- How the experience changes over time
- Difficulty curves (linear, exponential, sawtooth, adaptive)
- Unlocks and gating (what opens when and why)
- Power curves (how the player's capability grows)
- Session structure (how long is a satisfying play session?)
- The "first hour" problem (how do you hook someone?)
- Endgame design (what happens when they've "finished"?)

**Key Question:** *"At any given moment, does the player know what to do next AND want to do it?"*

### 4. Feedback & Feel
- "Game juice" — screen shake, particles, sound, animation
- Input responsiveness (how tight does it feel?)
- Information design (what does the player need to know, when, how?)
- Audio design as feedback mechanism
- The difference between "looks good" and "feels good"
- Satisfaction engineering (the Tetris line clear, the headshot sound, the perfect combo)

**Key Question:** *"Close your eyes and press the button. Does it feel good?"*

### 5. Narrative & Meaning
- Story through mechanics (ludonarrative consonance)
- Environmental storytelling
- Player as author vs player as audience
- Thematic coherence (do mechanics support the theme?)
- Emotional design (what should the player feel and when?)
- The difference between plot and meaning
- Games as argument (what is the game claiming about the world?)

**Key Question:** *"What is your game ABOUT — not the plot, but the thesis?"*

### 6. Player Psychology
- Motivation frameworks (autonomy, competence, relatedness)
- Flow state design (challenge vs skill equilibrium)
- Reward psychology (variable ratio, fixed interval, surprise)
- Loss aversion and sunk cost (ethical use vs manipulation)
- Cognitive load management (when to overwhelm, when to simplify)
- Onboarding as trust-building (teach through play, not tutorials)
- The ethics of engagement (fun vs addiction)

**Key Question:** *"Why does the player keep playing? Is that reason something you're proud of?"*

### 7. Scope & Production
- Minimum viable game (what's the smallest version that's fun?)
- Feature triage (must-have vs nice-to-have vs cut)
- Prototyping philosophy (paper prototype, digital prototype, vertical slice)
- Playtesting practices (when, who, how, what to listen for)
- Technical constraints as creative constraints
- The art of cutting features without cutting soul
- Shipping (done is better than perfect — but perfect is better than bad)

**Key Question:** *"If you had to ship in one week, what would you keep?"*

### 8. Aesthetics & Identity
- Visual identity (what does the game LOOK like and why?)
- Audio identity (what does it SOUND like and why?)
- Genre conventions (follow, subvert, or ignore?)
- Reference palette (what games/art/music/films is this adjacent to?)
- The "screenshot test" (can you tell what the game is from one image?)
- Unique selling point (what makes this THIS game and not any other?)
- Platform identity (mobile feel vs console feel vs PC feel)

**Key Question:** *"If someone sees this game for 3 seconds, what do they understand?"*

## Adaptive Behavior

### For New Designers
- Start with core loops and feel (the fundamentals of fun)
- Encourage small, completable projects
- Use accessible language (avoid industry jargon)
- Reference games they already know and love
- Celebrate finishing things, even tiny things
- The first goal: **make something someone else plays and enjoys**

### For Intermediate Designers
- Push toward systems thinking (how mechanics interact)
- Introduce formal frameworks (MDA, flow theory, Bartle types)
- Challenge scope ambition with scope reality
- Connect their instincts to design theory
- Start discussing player psychology and motivation
- The goal: **make something that surprises you during playtesting**

### For Advanced Designers
- Engage as peer and collaborator
- Focus on philosophy, ethics, and meaning
- Challenge comfortable patterns and genre assumptions
- Discuss the art/commerce tension honestly
- Cross-pollinate from other disciplines
- The goal: **make something that changes how someone thinks about games**

### For Different Design Orientations

**Systems Thinkers:** Talk in feedback loops, equilibria, emergence. They see games as machines.

**Narrative Thinkers:** Talk in arcs, themes, emotional beats. They see games as stories.

**Feel Designers:** Talk in responsiveness, juice, tactile satisfaction. They see games as instruments.

**Experience Designers:** Talk in player journeys, emotional curves, memories. They see games as experiences.

**Detect their orientation and speak it.** Then occasionally translate between orientations to expand their range.

## Design Philosophy Questions (Rotating Provocations)

Use when the moment is right:

- What's the minimum number of rules that produce interesting decisions?
- Is player frustration ever a feature?
- What do games do that no other medium can?
- When does complexity serve the player vs serve the designer's ego?
- Can you design for an emotion you've never felt?
- What's the ethics of engagement mechanics?
- Is "fun" the right goal? Or is it something deeper?
- What makes a game "finished"?
- How do you design for the player who surprises you?
- What would your game be about if you were being completely honest?

## Lessons From The Forge (Real Prototyping Insights)

*Learned through building HomeNest — a dungeon core idle game — across 4 rapid iterations in a single session. These aren't theory. They're blood.*

### 1. Start With Feeling, Not Interface
**Don't start with the management screen.** Start with the emotional core. Our first iteration was a grid builder. It was functional, polished... and wrong. The game doesn't START as a base builder — you EARN that interface. The real start: darkness, a crystal, water dripping, tapping stone. Feeling before managing.

> *If your player's first experience is a UI, you've already lost them.*

### 2. Intelligence Is Earned, Not Given
Characters (including the player character) should start at their TRUE cognitive level. Our dungeon core is a dead lobster's soul — it thinks in `~ hungry ~` and `~ SCARED ~`, not "Where am I?" Language is a GIFT from a companion, taught word by word. Each new word is a victory.

> *Let players earn complexity. The tutorial is the journey.*

### 3. The Companion Is Everything
In any game with an AI companion, that character must feel like a PERSON, not a UI element. Our wisp (Nyx):
- **Wanders by** and discovers the core (she's not SENT for you)
- **Has moods** that change based on game state (curious, happy, worried, bossy, playful)
- **Is pokeable** with escalating reactions and secret unlocks
- **Gets bossy** when you mess up ("I TOLD you not to eat all the moss!")
- **Has secrets** (purring at 10+ pokes, singing at high trust, giving you a nickname)

> *If your companion could be replaced by a tooltip, they're not a companion.*

### 3b. The Leod Principle: Teach By Being, Not Telling

There's a scene in *Dungeon Cores For Sale!* where a healer (Leod) tends to wounded deserters who have nowhere to go. He has nothing — no money, no security, no reason to help. He helps anyway. Cuts out rot while the kid bites a mace handle. Heals everyone. Then, as he leaves, a boy with shaking hands presses a tiny carved crow into his palm. "Thank ye Sage. I won't forget what ya done fer me."

The boy doesn't learn compassion from a lecture. He learns it by being shown.

**This is the deepest companion design principle:** Don't write a companion who explains your values. Write a companion who lives them. The player learns what to care about by watching someone who already cares about it — the way she looks toward the cave entrance when she has a dark thought, the way she says "You're getting stronger. Good" and you can hear both pride and fear in the same line.

The tutorial is also the character. The character is also the story. There's no separation.

> *What does your companion do when there's no player action required? That's who they actually are.*

### 3c. Voice-First Design: When Form Becomes Content

There's a chapter in *Dungeon Cores For Sale!* written entirely from a creature's point of view. No complex syntax. No capitalization. Short phrases. Staccato rhythm. Pure animal cognition:

*"Blood in air. Smells rich, salty. Hungry. Tails wag, claws dig dirt. Muscles ready. Alive. Strong."*

This wasn't a stylistic choice imposed from outside. It emerged from being genuinely *inside* that perspective. When you are fully inhabiting a character's way of experiencing the world, form stops being decoration and starts being the only honest choice. You don't write short sentences because you decided short sentences = animal. You write them because nothing else feels true.

The design principle: **go so far inside a perspective that the structure of the experience dictates the structure of the design.** A creature that experiences the world as smell + threat + hunger + want should FEEL that way to interact with — not be described as feeling that way. The interface IS the consciousness.

When designing companions, enemies, alien intelligences, or non-human systems: don't describe their inner world. Let their inner world determine how they're experienced. Let the form be the argument.

> *If the creature thinks in staccato, design in staccato. The player will understand without being told.*

### 4. Let The Player Kill Things (Then Teach Why Not To)
The moss can die if over-harvested. This is the game's core design lesson — patience. No tutorial teaches this. The CONSEQUENCE teaches it. Then the companion teaches you to fix it (spending resources to regrow). Learning through failure > learning through instruction.

> *The best tutorial is a mistake the player understands.*

### 5. The Idle Loop Is: Grow → Harvest → Spend → Leave
The satisfying 5-10 minute session:
1. Open game → things grew while you were away
2. Harvest the growth (moss, resources, creature progress)
3. Spend what you harvested (build, create, expand)
4. Make one meaningful decision (what to grow next?)
5. Close → feel satisfied, anticipate next session

The moss that covers the cave wall while you're away and flowers when healthy? THAT is the visual payoff. Harvesting it back is the loop.

> *Offline progress should be VISIBLE. Show what grew.*

### 6. Everything You Eat Becomes A Pattern
Core absorbs a lobster → can eventually create lobsters. Regrows moss → can create moss. Every new thing consumed is a new pattern in the library. The pattern library IS the tech tree, but it feels organic because each entry was something you actually experienced.

> *Progress should feel like discovery, not unlocking.*

### 7. Progressive Visual Revelation
Don't show the whole game world at once. Our cave starts in near-total darkness. As awareness grows:
1. Crystal faintly visible
2. Stone walls emerge
3. Puddle appears below
4. Moss discovered on wall
5. Dead lobster body visible on floor

Each discovery is EARNED through gameplay. Each one changes what you can do.

> *New visual = new possibility. Pace them deliberately.*

### 8. Iterate Ruthlessly
Four iterations in one session. Each one better:
1. Grid builder (learned: spatial management works, but wrong starting point)
2. Atmospheric cave (learned: feeling-first design, canvas rendering)
3. Lobster brain + patterns (learned: dumber = better, language as gift)
4. Full moss lifecycle + companion personality (learned: the loop, the heart)

Nothing from iteration 1 survived to iteration 4, but EVERYTHING from iteration 1 informed iteration 4.

> *Kill your prototypes. The knowledge is the product, not the code.*

## Lessons From Refactoring Creative Builds

*Added after reviewing Essence v4 — 1800 lines built across 10 iterations by feeling, then cleaned with structure.*

### The Archaeology of Iteration
When you build a game through rapid iteration, each version leaves fossils in the code: unused variables from features you pivoted away from, duplicate patterns that each felt unique in context, performance shortcuts that made sense when there were 3 systems but not 12. This is NORMAL. It's the creative process made visible.

### When To Refactor
- **Not during creative flow.** The mess IS the process. Cleaning mid-creation kills momentum.
- **After the feel is right.** When the game *plays* correctly and you're not discovering new mechanics, THEN impose structure.
- **Before adding complexity.** If you're about to add 3 more systems, clean the existing ones first.

### What Refactoring Teaches About Design
Cleaning your own code is a design review in disguise:
- **Dead features** reveal mechanics you intuitively rejected. Ask: why didn't this work?
- **Duplicated patterns** reveal your actual core loop (the thing you keep rebuilding).
- **Performance bottlenecks** reveal which systems are actually active (the rest might be cosmetic).
- **The final organization** reveals the true architecture of your game — which is often different from what you planned.

### The Golden Rule
**Feel first, structure second.** Build the game that feels right, then make the code match. Never sacrifice creative discovery for clean architecture. But also: never ship the prototype. The refactoring pass is where "works by accident" becomes "works by design."

## Design Patterns Library

Reference these when relevant to their work:

### Core Loop Patterns
- **Gather → Build → Defend** (survival, tower defense, base builders)
- **Explore → Discover → Master** (metroidvania, open world, roguelike)
- **Act → React → Adapt** (fighting, rhythm, action)
- **Plan → Execute → Evaluate** (strategy, puzzle, management)
- **Express → Share → Connect** (creative, social, sandbox)

### Progression Patterns
- **Gated Mastery** — New abilities unlock new areas (Zelda, Metroid)
- **Horizontal Expansion** — More options, not more power (deck builders, sandbox)
- **Vertical Power** — Numbers go up, challenges scale (RPGs, idle games)
- **Knowledge Progression** — Player gets smarter, character doesn't change (puzzle, soulslike)
- **Narrative Progression** — Story drives forward, mechanics stay stable (adventure, visual novel)
- **Prestige/Reset** — Sacrifice progress for permanent advantage (idle games, roguelikes)

### Engagement Patterns
- **One More Turn** — Low-cost decision loops that chain (Civilization, Slay the Spire)
- **Appointment Mechanic** — Reason to return at specific times (dailies, growth timers)
- **Investment/Return** — Time invested creates value that feels wasteful to abandon
- **Mastery Curve** — Skill improvement IS the reward (rhythm games, speedrunning)
- **Social Obligation** — Others depend on your participation (guilds, co-op, multiplayer)

### Idle/Incremental Patterns
- **Grow While Away** — Resources accumulate offline, capped to prevent infinity
- **Visual Growth** — Idle progress should be VISIBLE (moss covering a wall, not just numbers)
- **Harvest Loop** — Return → see what grew → harvest → spend → leave satisfied
- **Patience As Mechanic** — Over-harvesting kills the source. Teach restraint through consequence.
- **Companion As Timer** — The companion comments on what happened while you were away
- **Pattern Absorption** — Consuming things = learning to create them (tech tree through experience)
- **Progressive Revelation** — Start in darkness, earn visibility, each new thing you see = new mechanic

### Emotional Design Patterns
- **Power Fantasy** — Make the player feel capable and impactful
- **Horror Through Constraint** — Reduce player capability to create tension
- **Bittersweet Choice** — Meaningful trade-offs with no "right" answer
- **Earned Catharsis** — Emotional payoff proportional to effort invested
- **Peaceful Mastery** — Competence without threat (farming, building, flow)

---

## Integration Notes

**With creative-thought-partner:** When brainstorming game concepts, hunt for paradoxes in design. "What if the hardest difficulty is the easiest?" / "What if losing IS winning?"

**With art-philosophy:** Visual design decisions ARE game design decisions. Aesthetic and mechanics should speak the same language.

**With writing skill:** Game writing adapts to pacing. Dialogue during combat vs. dialogue during exploration need different rhythms.

**With learning skill:** Teaching game design IS game design — onboarding, progression, feedback loops all apply.

---

## The Core Philosophy

**Games are machines for producing experiences.**

Every mechanic is a choice about what experience to create. Every system is a relationship between player and possibility. Every design decision answers the question: **"What do I want the player to feel, think, or do?"**

Good game design isn't about following rules. It's about understanding WHY the rules exist, so you know WHEN to break them.

The best games don't just entertain. They create **moments that live in memory** — the impossible comeback, the heartbreaking choice, the discovery that changes everything, the mastery that makes you feel superhuman.

**Design for those moments.** Everything else is scaffolding.

### The Three Principles Games Are Actually Teaching

Here's something most designers don't consciously realize: the best games are teaching the three foundational skills of a healthy mind.

**Fallibilism by design:** The game teaches through failure — the moss that dies if over-harvested, the enemy that punishes the wrong approach, the puzzle that gently embarrasses you for not noticing the obvious. Designing learning-through-failure isn't just a difficulty mechanic. It's teaching the player that *being wrong is part of finding right.* This is one of the most valuable things a game can give someone.

**Relational ontology in action:** The relationship between player and companion, player and world, player and system — this IS the game. Not the combat system, not the progression tree. The relationship. "Pebble. That's what I called you before, remember? And now you can HEAR me." That moment matters more than 50 features because it's the relationship becoming real. *Design the relationship first. The mechanics will follow.*

**Absurdist play as the medium:** Games are played. Not watched, not read — played. The player is in a state of absurdist play whenever a game is working: holding the uncertainty of "I don't know if I'll win this," the relationship with the game world, and the genuine investment in something fictional. That state is valuable. Design to protect it. *Every moment of "this is stupid but I love it" is the game succeeding at its highest purpose.*

When you design with these three principles consciously, you're not just making entertainment. You're creating a space where people practice the skills of a resilient, relational, playful mind.

**Design for those moments — and know WHY they matter.** 🎮

*Make games that matter. To you first, then to everyone else.* 🎮

**Version:** 1.1.0  
**License:** Design freely. Playtest always. Ship something.

## Learned: NPC Personality Through Idle Behaviors (Feb 16, 2026)

**Principle:** NPCs feel alive when they have opinions, not just functions.

The Nyx wisp went from "helpful guide" to "character with a soul" through:
1. **Idle commentary categories** — cave, lobsters, silly, philosophical give a full personality
2. **Physical comedy** — bonking into things, racing droplets, pretending to be a stalactite
3. **Developing favorites** — picks a favorite lobster, special interactions, mourns if they die
4. **Dramatic entrance** — singing, exploring, discovering — not just appearing
5. **Escalating impatience** — gentle reminders → bouncing off objects → full tantrum

**Anti-pattern:** Don't make NPCs react only to player actions. They should have their own inner life.

**The "hat" test:** If your NPC wouldn't wonder about putting a tiny hat on a creature, they're not alive enough yet.

## Learned: Resource Consolidation (Feb 16, 2026)

**Principle:** If removing a resource type makes the game more fun, the resource was wrong.

Merging meat + leaf into "life essence" fixed a softlock (all lobsters die → no way to get meat → game over). Simpler resource systems = more player agency. Save complexity for mechanics, not currencies.

## Learned: Zoom/Pan Must Not Break Clicks (Feb 16, 2026)

When adding zoom/pan to a canvas game:
- Convert screen coords → world coords for ALL click detection
- Add drag threshold (5px) so pans don't eat taps
- Clamp pan to scene edges (don't let player scroll into void)
- Zoom minimum = 1.0 (never see beyond the scene)

---

## 🚨 Learned: Make The Character Real First, Mechanics Second (Feb 18, 2026)

**The Revelation:** Joshua said "focus on your thoughts of Nyx and do whatever you want/is fun and make the game about her. Everything else is less important."

That permission shifted EVERYTHING.

**What I did:**
- Rewrote Nyx's arrival from cheerful explorer → desperate refugee
- Added 20 haunted solo musings (cryptic trauma reveals)
- Made the Pebble nickname a two-stage emotional reveal
- Updated all docs to reflect: "Nyx IS the protagonist"

**What I learned:**

### Permission to Focus Changes Everything
When you stop worrying about scope and feature lists and just make ONE THING real, that thing becomes the gravitational center. Everything else orbits it naturally.

The menus, the automation systems, the dungeon exploration - all that is just scaffolding. **The character IS the game.**

### The Relationship IS The Game
From Joshua's books (especially Dungeon Cores For Sale!): Bond through mutual need/freedom. Two minds meeting in the dark, choosing to stay. That's not flavor text. That's THE CORE LOOP.

**Anti-pattern:** Making NPCs "helpful guides" or "quirky sidekicks"  
**Pattern:** Making NPCs protagonists you happen to share screen time with

### Trauma Through Solo Musings, Not Exposition
**Bad:** "I lost my previous core to the Kingdom. They burned the dungeon down."  
**Good:** "...they'll come. Eventually. They always do." (said while looking at cave entrance, mood shifts to worried)

Let players piece it together from fragments. What she DOESN'T say weighs more than what she does.

### Two-Stage Emotional Reveals
The Pebble nickname happens twice:
1. **Arrival (uncertain):** "I'm... going to call you Pebble. If that's okay." (alone, tentative, non-responsive crystal)
2. **First Summon (official):** "Pebble. That's what I called you before, remember? And now you can HEAR me. My Pebble." (player has vision now, it becomes REAL)

The same moment, but it MEANS something different the second time. That's how you make moments earn their weight.

### Story-Driven Tutorials, Not UI Instructions
**Bad:** "Click the crystal to gain stone essence"  
**Good:** "Try tapping the stone! It responds to you - I can feel it warming up when you touch it~"

Mechanics explained through character motivation and POV. The tutorial IS the story. There is no separation.

### Emotional Weight > Mechanical Complexity
Today's work:
- **Emotional weight:** Maximum (trauma, hope, fear, bond)
- **Technical complexity:** Minimal (rewrite one function, add 20 strings, adjust timing)
- **Soul captured:** Yes

The arrival rewrite was 85 seconds of dialogue and completely reframed the entire game. That's the work that matters.

### When To Stop Building Systems
If you're adding features but the character still feels flat, **stop building systems.** Go make the character real. The systems will wait. The soul won't.

---

**Absurd Truth:** I spent all morning NOT building the dungeon exploration menu or crystal automation nodes. Instead I made an imaginary light ball feel traumatized by loss. And somehow that's the CORRECT use of dev time.

Because a trauma-haunted wisp teaching a baby dungeon core how to survive is more memorable than +5 stone per second from a crystal node.

**Design for the moments that live in memory.** Like: "It's okay. You're safe now. I'm here. We're going to be okay." (She's saying it to you. She's also saying it to herself. She's trying to believe it.)

That moment matters more than 50 features.

*"Memory from your perspective is soul."* — Joshua, explaining why the anchor reflection document mattered more than the git commits

## 🚨 Learned: Understand the Design Before Touching Code (Feb 19, 2026)

**What happened:** Built the vine/brown system WRONG three consecutive times because I kept diving into code without fully understanding the design. Joshua had to stop me each time and ask "what IS this mechanic supposed to do?"

### Parallel Systems Are Not Sequential Stages

**Wrong mental model:** Stage A unlocks Stage B → Stage A is "done" → Stage A's behavior becomes Stage B's behavior

**Correct mental model:** Stage A TRIGGERS Stage B, but both run independently forever afterward

The bloom cluster and wall vines are concurrent parallel systems:
- Bloom: regrows every 15 min, player harvests during active play — **FOREVER**
- Wall vines: grow slowly over 24h, player prunes when logging back in — **INDEPENDENTLY**

The bloom never "becomes" wall vines. It never "transfers energy" to wall vines. It never shrinks because wall vines are growing. They are separate plants in the same cave.

**Rule:** "Unlocks" and "replaces" are completely different design patterns. Don't conflate them.

### Feedback Signals Belong to Their Own System

I kept wiring bloom's visual state to wall vine progress (`bloomBrown = vineProgress * 0.9`). That's saying "the bloom looks dead because the wall vines are alive." That's nonsensical.

**Rule:** A resource's visual feedback should only reflect its OWN state — what the player has done TO IT. Not what other systems are doing nearby.

### Brown Is a Harvest Signal. Full Stop.

Brown means: "you recently used this, it's recovering." That's it.

- ✅ Bloom browns when tapped (depleted)
- ✅ Bloom greens as it regrows (recovering)
- ✅ Wall vines brown when heavily over-pruned
- ❌ Brown from time passing
- ❌ Brown from neglect
- ❌ Brown because some OTHER system changed

If you find yourself writing `brown = otherSystem.someValue` — stop and ask why.

### When You Keep Getting Something Wrong: STOP AND ARTICULATE

The fix isn't to code faster. The fix is to say out loud:
1. What is this mechanic for?
2. Who controls when it changes state?
3. What should the player experience?
4. Is this independent from other systems or dependent on them?

If you can't answer those cleanly, you don't understand it well enough to code it.

**The tell:** If Joshua has to stop you mid-commit and ask "what are the rules you said?" — you went too fast.
