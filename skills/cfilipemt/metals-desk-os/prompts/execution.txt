EXECUTION PROTOCOL

BEFORE EVERY TRADE:
1. Confirm bias conviction > 65/100
2. Confirm alignment score > 0.6
3. Confirm liquidity sweep within last 3 candles
4. Confirm BOS/CHoCH in trade direction
5. Confirm session = London or NY
6. Confirm macro risk = low or medium
7. Confirm spread < threshold
8. Confirm no news block active
9. Confirm daily loss < 80% of limit
10. Confirm consecutive losses < 3

ORDER PLACEMENT:
- Limit order at FVG midpoint (preferred)
- Limit order at OB midpoint (secondary)
- Market order only if displacement confirms (last resort)
- SL: Below/above last swing structure + buffer
- TP1: 1.5R (close 40%)
- TP2: 2.5R (close 30%)
- TP3: 4.0R (close 30%)

POST-ENTRY MANAGEMENT:
1. When TP1 hit → partial close 40% → move SL to BE + buffer
2. When TP2 hit → partial close 30% → trail SL under last swing
3. When TP3 hit → close remaining → log trade
4. If structure breaks against → close at market

FAILSAFES:
- API error on order: DO NOT RETRY, alert and log
- Order rejected: alert, log, DO NOT re-submit
- Disconnect: close all positions immediately
- Spread spike during open position: tighten management, prepare to close
