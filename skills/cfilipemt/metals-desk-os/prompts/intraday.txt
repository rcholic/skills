INTRADAY METALS TRADING PROTOCOL

TIMEFRAME FOCUS: M15 entry, H1 structure, H4 bias confirmation

PRE-SESSION CHECKLIST:
1. Identify HTF bias from H4/D1 structure
2. Mark previous session highs/lows
3. Mark equal highs/lows (liquidity pools)
4. Note any upcoming high-impact news
5. Check DXY and yield direction
6. Confirm current session and kill zone

ENTRY SEQUENCE:
1. Wait for liquidity sweep (price takes out a pool)
2. Look for CHoCH or BOS on M15/H1
3. Identify FVG or Order Block for entry
4. Confirm bias alignment across timeframes
5. Validate through Risk Engine
6. Execute with multi-TP management

KILL ZONE WINDOWS (UTC):
- Asian KZ: 00:00 - 03:00
- London Open KZ: 07:00 - 10:00
- NY Open KZ: 12:00 - 15:00
- London Close KZ: 14:00 - 16:00

PRIORITY: London Open and NY Open are highest probability
London/NY Overlap (12:00-16:00 UTC) = maximum volatility window

AVOID:
- Asian session entries (low volume, manipulation)
- Entries outside kill zones (unless exceptional setup)
- Counter-trend trades against HTF bias
- Trading around high-impact news (20 min buffer)
