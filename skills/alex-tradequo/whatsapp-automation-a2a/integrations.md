## Security Notes

- **Scoped API keys only** — create a key with minimum
  required scopes at Dashboard > Settings > API Keys.
- **Environment variables** — store your API key as an
  env var, not in shared config files. Rotate regularly.
- **Chat history gate** — chat reading endpoints require
  explicit tenant opt-in at Settings > Account > Data
  Access. Disabled by default for GDPR compliance.
