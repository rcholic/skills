# MoltFlow Leads -- Detection & CRM Pipeline

Auto-detect purchase-intent leads from monitored WhatsApp groups, track them through a sales pipeline, perform bulk operations, and export for your CRM.

## When to Use

- "List leads" or "show detected leads"
- "Update lead status" or "mark lead as contacted"
- "Bulk update leads" or "change status for multiple leads"
- "Add leads to group" or "bulk add to custom group"
- "Export leads as CSV" or "download leads JSON"
- "Check lead reciprocity" or "has this lead messaged me?"
- "Filter leads by status" or "search leads"

## Prerequisites

1. **MOLTFLOW_API_KEY** -- Generate from the [MoltFlow Dashboard](https://molt.waiflow.app) under Settings > API Keys
2. At least one monitored WhatsApp group with keyword detection enabled
3. Base URL: `https://apiv2.waiflow.app/api/v2`

## Authentication

Every request must include one of:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

or

```
X-API-Key: <your_api_key>
```

## How Lead Detection Works

1. You monitor WhatsApp groups via the Groups API (see `moltflow` skill)
2. Set `monitor_mode: "keywords"` with keywords like `"looking for"`, `"price"`, `"interested"`
3. When a group member sends a message matching your keywords, MoltFlow auto-creates a lead
4. Leads appear in the Leads API with status `new` and the triggering keyword highlighted
5. You track them through the pipeline: `new` -> `contacted` -> `qualified` -> `converted`

## Leads API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/leads` | List leads (filter by status, group, search) |
| GET | `/leads/{id}` | Get lead details |
| PATCH | `/leads/{id}/status` | Update lead status (state machine validated) |
| GET | `/leads/{id}/reciprocity` | Check if lead messaged you first (anti-spam) |
| POST | `/leads/bulk/status` | Bulk update lead status |
| POST | `/leads/bulk/add-to-group` | Bulk add leads to custom group |
| GET | `/leads/export/csv` | Export as CSV (Pro+ plan, max 10,000) |
| GET | `/leads/export/json` | Export as JSON (Pro+ plan, max 10,000) |

### List Leads

**GET** `/leads`

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Filter by status (`new`, `contacted`, `qualified`, `converted`, `lost`) |
| `source_group_id` | UUID | Filter by source monitored group |
| `search` | string | Search in contact name, phone, or keyword |
| `limit` | int | Page size (default 50) |
| `offset` | int | Pagination offset |

**Response** `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "leads": [
    {
      "id": "lead-uuid-...",
      "contact_phone": "+15550123456",
      "contact_name": "John D.",
      "lead_status": "new",
      "lead_score": 0,
      "lead_detected_at": "2026-02-12T14:30:00Z",
      "source_group": {
        "id": "group-uuid-...",
        "name": "Real Estate IL"
      },
      "trigger": {
        "matched_keyword": "interested in buying",
        "message_preview": "Hi, I'm interested in buying a 3-bedroom...",
        "monitor_mode": "keywords",
        "detected_at": "2026-02-12T14:30:00Z"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 47,
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0
}
```

### Get Lead Details

**GET** `/leads/{id}`

Returns full lead info including group context, detection metadata, message count, and status.

### Update Lead Status

**PATCH** `/leads/{id}/status`

```json
{
  "status": "contacted"
}
```

**State machine validation** -- only valid transitions are allowed:

- `new` -> `contacted`, `qualified`, `converted`, `lost`
- `contacted` -> `qualified`, `converted`, `lost`
- `qualified` -> `converted`, `lost`
- `converted` -> (terminal -- no further transitions)
- `lost` -> `new` (reopen only)

Invalid transitions return `400 Bad Request`.

### Reciprocity Check

**GET** `/leads/{id}/reciprocity?session_id=session-uuid`

The `session_id` query parameter is **required** -- it specifies which WhatsApp session to check inbound messages from.

```json
{
  "lead_id": "lead-uuid-...",
  "has_messaged_first": true,
  "last_inbound_at": "2026-02-12T15:00:00Z"
}
```

Use this before reaching out -- if the lead hasn't messaged you directly, sending a cold message may trigger WhatsApp spam detection.

### Bulk Status Update

**POST** `/leads/bulk/status`

```json
{
  "lead_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "status": "contacted"
}
```

**Response** `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "updated": 3,
  "failed": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

Each lead is individually validated against the state machine. Leads with invalid transitions are reported in `errors` but don't block the rest.

### Bulk Add to Custom Group

**POST** `/leads/bulk/add-to-group`

```json
{
  "lead_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"],
  "custom_group_id": "custom-group-uuid-..."
}
```

Adds leads' phone numbers to the specified custom group for use with Bulk Send or Scheduled Messages.

### Export Leads

**GET** `/leads/export/csv` -- Returns CSV file download
**GET** `/leads/export/json` -- Returns JSON array

Both support optional filters: `status`, `source_group_id`, `search`. Max 10,000 rows per export.

**Requires Pro plan or above.**
