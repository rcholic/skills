## Tips

- **Sentiment threshold**: Start with `0.6` and adjust up if you get too many false positives.
- **Keyword filters**: Use `include_keywords` to match industry-specific praise terms.
- **Manual scan**: Use `POST /reviews/collectors/{id}/run` after connecting a new session to backfill reviews.
- **Export regularly**: Export approved testimonials for website widgets, social media, or marketing materials.
