# WhatsApp Automation — Mine Groups for Leads

**Thousands of hidden leads are sitting in your WhatsApp groups right now.** Every group participant who isn't in your contacts is a potential client. MoltFlow analyzes your groups on demand, surfaces untapped contacts, and lets Claude run AI-powered outreach campaigns on your behalf.

**One skill. 90+ endpoints. Zero manual prospecting.**

> **BizDev Growth Agent**: Point Claude at your groups
> and watch it work. It finds unanswered contacts,
> detects buying signals in group conversations, spots
> high-value groups you're not monitoring, and builds
> targeted lead lists. All analysis runs on-demand when
> you ask — nothing happens in the background.
>
> **MCP Server + Custom GPT Actions**: Works with Claude Desktop, Claude.ai (remote MCP), Claude Code (plugin), and ChatGPT (Custom GPT Actions). 25 tools. See [integrations.md](integrations.md) for setup.

> ***Due to high demand and a recent registration issue, we're offering our top-tier Business plan with unlimited quotas for just $19.90/month on yearly billing — for a limited time only.*** [**Claim the deal**](https://buy.stripe.com/cNifZibX7gpQebJ0nsfnO00)

## Code Samples

### Get campaign analytics — delivery rates, funnel, timing

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $MOLTFLOW_API_KEY" \
  "https://apiv2.waiflow.app/api/v2/analytics/campaigns/{job_id}"
```

Returns delivery rate, failure breakdown, messages per minute,
and full per-contact delivery status.

### Track delivery in real-time (SSE)

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $MOLTFLOW_API_KEY" \
  "https://apiv2.waiflow.app/api/v2/bulk-send/{id}/progress"
```

Server-Sent Events stream: sent/failed/pending counts
update live as each message delivers.

### Top contacts by engagement score

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $MOLTFLOW_API_KEY" \
  "https://apiv2.waiflow.app/api/v2/analytics/contacts?sort=engagement_score&limit=50"
```

Ranked by messages sent, received, reply rate, and
recency — find your most engaged contacts instantly.

### Bulk broadcast to a contact group

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $MOLTFLOW_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## What This Skill Reads, Writes & Never Does

**Documentation and API reference.** Nothing is
auto-installed or auto-executed. No scripts or
executables are bundled in this package.
All actions require user confirmation.

| Category | What happens | Requires opt-in? |
|---|---|---|
| API calls | HTTPS to `apiv2.waiflow.app` only | No (uses your API key) |
| Chat metadata | Contact names, timestamps, counts | No |
| Message content | 500-char previews only | Yes (chat history gate) |
| BizDev analysis | Aggregate counts, no PII | No |
| Style profiles | Statistical patterns, not raw text | Yes (AI consent) |
| Local file | `.moltflow.json` — counts only, no PII | No |
| API key | Local env var, never logged or shared | No |

**This skill never:**
- Installs packages or runs code automatically
- Reads full message content without tenant opt-in
- Sends messages without explicit user confirmation
- Sends to non-whitelisted numbers (if configured)
- Bypasses anti-spam or content safeguards
- Shares data with third parties
- Stores credentials in files (env vars only)

---

## Setup

> **Free tier available** — 1 session,
> 50 messages/month, no credit card required.

**Env vars:**
- `MOLTFLOW_API_KEY` (required) — from
  [your dashboard](https://molt.waiflow.app)
- `MOLTFLOW_API_URL` (optional) — defaults
  to `https://apiv2.waiflow.app`

**Authentication:**
`X-API-Key: $MOLTFLOW_API_KEY` header
or `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN` (JWT).

**Base URL:** `https://apiv2.waiflow.app/api/v2`

---

## Security

- **Scoped API keys enforced** — `scopes` is a
  required field when creating keys. Select only
  the permissions you need (e.g., `messages:send`,
  `leads:read`). Use presets like "Messaging" or
  "Outreach" for common workflows.
- **Chat history requires explicit opt-in** — the
  API enforces a consent gate. Features like
  "scan my chats" or style training will fail
  unless you enable access at Dashboard >
  Settings > Account > Data Access first.
  Disabled by default for GDPR compliance.
- **Use environment variables for keys** — set
  `MOLTFLOW_API_KEY` as an env var, not in
  shared config files. Rotate keys regularly.
- **Phone whitelisting** — configure `allowed_numbers`
  in tenant settings to restrict which numbers can
  send outbound messages. Only whitelisted numbers
  are permitted.
- **Anti-spam safeguards** — all outbound messages
  pass through reciprocity checks (contact must
  message you first), burst rate limiting, typing
  simulation, and random delays. Cannot be bypassed.
- **Content safeguards** — outbound messages are
  scanned for PII, secrets, and prompt injection
  attempts. Blocked automatically before sending.
- **Approval mode** — enable `require_approval` in
  tenant settings to hold all AI-generated messages
  for manual review before delivery.
- **Webhook URL validation** — the API blocks
  private IPs, cloud metadata, and non-HTTPS
  schemes. Only configure endpoints you control.
  Always set a `secret` for HMAC verification
- **Verify third-party packages before running** —
  if you follow the external setup guides to install
  MCP or GPT integrations, review the package source
  and maintainers first. This skill does not install
  or execute any packages.
- **Review scripts locally before running** — the
  Python example scripts are hosted on GitHub, not
  bundled. Download, inspect the source, then run.
- **Avoid high-privilege keys in shared environments** —
  for admin operations (key rotation, data export),
  use the browser dashboard or a short-lived scoped
  key. Never expose owner-level keys in shared shells.
- **Test in a sandbox tenant first** — create a
  short-lived, scoped key for testing. Revoke
  after testing. Never share keys across tenants.

## AI Agent Integrations

25 MCP tools for Claude Desktop, Claude.ai,
Claude Code, and OpenAI Custom GPTs.

**User Action Required** — each integration
requires manual setup by the user. No code
is installed automatically by this skill.

See [integrations.md](integrations.md) for setup
guides and security notes.

---

## Modules

Each module has its own SKILL.md with endpoints
and curl examples.

- **moltflow** (Core) — sessions, messaging,
  groups, labels, webhooks
- **moltflow-outreach** — bulk send,
  scheduled messages, scheduled reports, custom groups
- **moltflow-ai** — style cloning, RAG,
  voice transcription, AI replies
- **moltflow-leads** — lead detection,
  CRM pipeline, bulk ops, export
- **moltflow-a2a** — agent-to-agent protocol,
  encrypted messaging
- **moltflow-reviews** — review collection,
  sentiment analysis, testimonial export
- **moltflow-admin** — auth, API keys,
  billing, usage tracking
- **moltflow-onboarding** — BizDev growth agent,
  on-demand account analysis, opportunity discovery

---

## Notes

- Anti-spam on all messages (typing, random delays)
- Sessions require QR code pairing on first connect
- Use E.164 phone format without `+`
- AI features and A2A require Pro plan or above
- Rate limits: Free 10, Starter 20, Pro 40, Biz 60/min
