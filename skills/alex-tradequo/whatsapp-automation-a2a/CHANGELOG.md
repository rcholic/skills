## v2.9.8 (2026-02-14)

### Changed
- **Integrations.md cleaned up** — simplified to setup guide links and security notes only
- **Changelog consolidated** — removed verbose patch-level entries

### Security
- **Documentation-only package** — zero executables, zero install scripts, zero local file writes
- **Scoped API keys enforced** — all examples use minimum required scopes; wildcard keys never recommended
- **Chat history gated** — API returns HTTP 403 until tenant explicitly opts in at Settings > Account > Data Access
- **High-privilege endpoints removed from skill docs** — only consumer-facing API endpoints documented; administrative operations available on website only
- **Model invocation disabled** — `disable-model-invocation: true` prevents autonomous agent actions; all operations require explicit user invocation
- **Anti-spam safeguards documented** — reciprocity checks, burst rate limits, and content safeguards apply to all outbound messages

---
