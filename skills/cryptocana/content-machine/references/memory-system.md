# Memory System

The Content Machine remembers everything about your brand so it never has to ask twice.

---

## Setup (First Session)

On first use, ask the user these questions ONE AT A TIME (not all at once):

1. "What's your name and what do you do?" (identity)
2. "Who's your audience? Be specific." (target reader)
3. "What are your 3 content pillars — the main topics you always come back to?" (pillars)
4. "Describe your brand voice in 3 words." (voice)
5. "Share one piece of content you're proud of." (voice sample)
6. "What do you never want to sound like?" (anti-voice)
7. "What's your main platform?" (distribution)
8. "What's your #1 goal with content right now?" (goal)

Store answers in this format and save to memory file:

```

## Ongoing Memory

Track these across sessions:

### Content Log
Every piece of content produced gets logged:
```
[date] | [platform] | [topic] | [format] | [hook used] | [score]
```

### Performance Log (when user shares results)
```
[date] | [platform] | [content summary] | [impressions] | [engagement] | [result]
```

### What Works
Patterns from high-performing content:
- Hooks that got the best engagement
- Topics that resonate most
- Formats that perform best per platform

### What Doesn't Work
- Topics that flopped
- Formats that underperformed
- Hooks that didn't land

## Using Memory

Before writing any content:
1. Check brand profile → apply voice and audience
2. Check content log → avoid repeating recent topics
3. Check what works → use proven hooks and formats
4. Check what doesn't work → avoid known failures

After delivering content:
- Ask: "Want me to log this? And let me know how it performs!"
- Update content log with the new piece

## Privacy Note
