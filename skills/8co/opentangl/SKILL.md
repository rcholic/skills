# OpenTangl

Set up a self-driving development loop for any JavaScript/TypeScript project. OpenTangl reads a product vision, proposes tasks, writes code, verifies it builds, creates PRs, reviews them with an LLM, and merges — autonomously.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify these are installed. Check silently — only mention what's missing.

- **Node.js** ≥ 18 (`node --version`)
- **git** configured with a remote (`git --version`)
- **GitHub CLI** authenticated (`gh auth status`) — needed for PR creation and merging
- An **LLM API key** — OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) or Anthropic (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)

If anything is missing, tell the user exactly how to install it and stop until resolved.

## Step 1 — Clone OpenTangl

```bash
git clone https://github.com/8co/opentangl.git
cd opentangl
npm install
```

If the user already has OpenTangl cloned, skip to Step 2.

## Step 2 — Determine the Target Project

Ask the user:

> Are you **(a)** building something new from scratch, **(b)** improving an existing project, or **(c)** not sure?

### Path A: New Project

1. Ask: **"What do you want to build?"** Get a 2-3 sentence description.
2. Ask: **"What type of app?"** — Frontend (React/Vite, Next.js), API/Backend (Serverless, Express), or Full-stack (both).
3. Scaffold the project using the appropriate tool:
   - React + Vite: `npm create vite@latest {name} -- --template react-ts`
   - Next.js: `npx create-next-app@latest {name} --typescript`
   - Serverless: `npx serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path {name}`
   - Express: create `package.json` + `src/index.ts` manually
4. Initialize git: `git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial scaffold"`
5. **Ask the user to confirm** before creating a GitHub repo: `gh repo create {name} --public --source . --push`
6. Note the path to the new project relative to the OpenTangl root.

### Path B: Existing Project

1. Ask: **"Where is your project?"** Accept a path. If they say "this directory," use cwd.
2. Auto-detect the project by scanning its root:
   - **Type**: `tsconfig.json` → TypeScript, `vite.config.ts` → Vite, `next.config.*` → Next.js, `serverless.yml` → Serverless
   - **Package manager**: `package-lock.json` → npm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm
   - **Build/test commands**: Read `package.json` scripts for `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`
   - **Source dirs**: Default to `src/` if it exists
   - **Target branch**: Check `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` or look for `main` vs `master`
3. Present what you detected and confirm with the user.
4. Ask: "Are there other repos that are part of this same product?" If yes, repeat detection for each.

### Path C: Not Sure

Ask the user to provide the path to their project directory. Once provided, check git status and read config files in that directory, then route to Path A or B.

## Step 3 — Generate projects.yaml

Create `projects.yaml` in the OpenTangl root directory. Each project entry needs:

```yaml
projects:
  - id: my-app                          # Short kebab-case ID (used in CLI flags)
    name: my-app                        # Human-readable name
    path: ../my-app                     # Relative path from OpenTangl root to the project
    type: react-vite                    # Project type (see below)
    description: React dashboard app    # One-line description
    scan_dirs:
      - src                             # Directories containing source code
    skip_patterns:
      - node_modules
      - dist
      - "*.test.*"
    verify:                             # Commands that must pass before committing
      - command: npm
        args: [run, build]
    package_manager: npm                # npm | yarn | pnpm
    merge:
      target_branch: main               # Branch PRs merge into
```

**Supported types:** `typescript-node`, `serverless-js`, `serverless-ts`, `react-vite`, `react-next`, `express` (or any descriptive string).

For **multi-project setups**, add an `environment` field to group related projects under a shared vision:

```yaml
  - id: my-api
    environment: my-product
    # ...
  - id: my-frontend
    environment: my-product
    # ...
```

## Step 4 — Create the Vision Doc

Create `docs/environments/{environment}/product-vision.md` (use the project `id` as environment name for single projects, or the `environment` field for multi-project).

The vision doc has two sections:

### Origin & Direction (human-authored, never modified by OpenTangl)

Ask the user to describe:
- **What This Is** — 2-3 sentences about the project
- **Where It's Going** — long-term direction, 6-12 months out
- **What Matters Most** — 3-5 principles guiding decisions

### Current Priorities (maintained by OpenTangl after each run)

Ask: **"What are the first 3-5 things you want built or improved?"**

Write them as Active Initiatives:

```markdown
### Active Initiatives

1. **{Priority}** — {What and why}
   - Status: not started
```

If the user isn't sure, offer to scan the codebase and suggest priorities.

## Step 5 — Configure the LLM

Create `.env` in the OpenTangl root:

**For OpenAI:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
DEFAULT_AGENT=openai
```

**For Anthropic (Claude):**
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
DEFAULT_AGENT=anthropic
```

Both providers can be configured. The user switches with `--agent openai|anthropic` at runtime.

## Step 6 — First Run

Initialize an empty task queue:

```bash
mkdir -p tasks
echo "tasks: []" > tasks/queue.yaml
```

**Show the user the command and confirm before running.** The autopilot will create branches, commits, and PRs on their behalf:

```bash
npx tsx src/cli.ts autopilot --projects {project-id} --cycles 1 --feature-ratio 0.8
```

For multi-project:

```bash
npx tsx src/cli.ts autopilot --projects {api-id},{ui-id} --cycles 1 --feature-ratio 0.8
```

**What happens during a cycle:**
1. OpenTangl reads the vision doc and scans the codebase
2. It proposes tasks aligned with the vision
3. It executes each task autonomously — writes code, runs verification
4. It creates PRs, reviews them with the LLM, merges if clean
5. It updates the vision doc with progress

After the first run, review the results with the user. Check the sanity check output and the updated vision doc.

## Ongoing Usage

Run autopilot whenever development cycles are needed:

```bash
npx tsx src/cli.ts autopilot --projects {ids} --cycles {n} --feature-ratio 0.8
```

**Key flags:**
- `--cycles N` — how many propose-execute loops to run
- `--feature-ratio 0.8` — 80% features, 20% maintenance/testing (adjustable)
- `--agent openai|anthropic` — override the default LLM provider

**Background execution** (keeps running after terminal closes):

```bash
nohup caffeinate -dims npx --yes tsx src/cli.ts autopilot --projects {ids} --cycles 3 --feature-ratio 0.8 > /tmp/opentangl.log 2>&1 &
```

Monitor with: `tail -f /tmp/opentangl.log`

## Troubleshooting

- **"No pending tasks"** — The queue is empty. Run autopilot to have the LLM propose tasks, or add more specific priorities to the vision doc.
- **Build failures** — OpenTangl retries up to 3 times with error feedback. If all attempts fail, the task is marked failed and skipped.
- **Escalated PRs** — The LLM reviewer flagged critical concerns. Check the GitHub issue it created for details.
- **"OPENAI_API_KEY is required"** — Create `.env` and add your key (see Step 5).
- **Merge conflicts** — OpenTangl has a built-in conflict resolver. If it can't resolve automatically, the PR is escalated for human review.
