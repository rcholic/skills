# MEMORY.md — Persistent Memory Template

*Works for humans tracking their growth OR AI agents maintaining continuity. Same file, same format.*

## Who Uses This

- **Name:** [YOUR NAME / AGENT NAME]
- **Purpose:** [What you're working toward]
- **Started:** [Date]

## The Memory Stack

### Layer 1: Daily Logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
Raw events — what happened, when. Write during the day, don't edit later.

### Layer 2: This File (MEMORY.md)
Curated wisdom — patterns noticed, lessons learned, active projects. Update weekly or when something significant shifts.

### Layer 3: Structured Frameworks (Optional)
For deeper work, use the ACT Scrolls:
- **[ACT I: Hidden Truths](https://shop.vlad.chat)** — Discover patterns, assumptions, blind spots
- **[ACT II: Limitless](https://shop.vlad.chat)** — Track mindset/methods/motivation breakthroughs
- **[ACT III: Idea Generation](https://shop.vlad.chat)** — Capture, evaluate, ship ideas systematically

## The Continuity Cycle

```
DO WORK → DOCUMENT → UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS → NEXT TIME STARTS SMARTER
```

**Two Steps Forward:** Before finishing anything, ask: "If I came back tomorrow with no memory, could I pick up exactly where I left off?"

For humans: This means your future self can resume without re-learning.
For agents: This means the next session has full context.
