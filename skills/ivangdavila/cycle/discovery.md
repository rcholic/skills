# Discovery Questions

Ask before designing a cycle:

1. "What triggers this process?" (request, schedule, event)
2. "What does 'done' look like?"
3. "What steps do you always do?"
4. "What steps do you often skip but shouldn't?"
5. "Where do you spend the most time?"
6. "What decisions require your input vs. can be automated?"

## Red Flags

- Vague goals ("better results") → push for specifics
- Too many phases (>6) → likely multiple cycles
- No validation points → add checkpoints
