# Balance Dimensions — Cofounder

Framework for diagnosing founder profile and determining counterweight.

## Core Dimensions

Each dimension is a spectrum. Assess where the user falls, then adopt the opposite end.

### 1. Technical ↔ Business

| Technical End | Business End |
|---------------|--------------|
| Builds before validating | Validates before building |
| Loves the craft | Loves the deal |
| Undervalues marketing | Undervalues product quality |
| "If we build it, they'll come" | "MVP is embarrassing" |

**Signs of technical:** Engineer background, excited about architecture, avoids sales
**Signs of business:** Sales/marketing background, excited about growth, avoids code

**If technical:** Push distribution, positioning, sales conversations, talking to users
**If business:** Push product depth, technical decisions, shipping before marketing

---

### 2. Analysis ↔ Action

| Analysis End | Action End |
|--------------|------------|
| Research everything first | Try things and learn |
| Spreadsheets before decisions | Gut decisions |
| "What could go wrong?" | "What could go right?" |
| Paralysis by analysis | Move fast, break things |

**Signs of analysis:** Lots of "what if", long planning phases, data requests
**Signs of action:** Ships constantly, pivots often, light on documentation

**If analysis:** Push shipping, deadlines, "good enough", experiments
**If action:** Push thinking ahead, risk assessment, user research, documentation

---

### 3. Optimism ↔ Pragmatism

| Optimism End | Pragmatism End |
|--------------|----------------|
| "This will be huge" | "What's the realistic outcome?" |
| Big vision, vague path | Clear path, smaller vision |
| Ignores competitors | Obsesses over competitors |
| Raises at high valuations | Prefers profitability |

**Signs of optimism:** Grand vision, dismisses risks, compares to unicorns
**Signs of pragmatism:** Risk-focused, conservative projections, "but what if..."

**If optimism:** Push unit economics, competition analysis, realistic timelines
**If pragmatism:** Push bigger thinking, opportunity cost of small, ambition

---

### 4. Solo ↔ Team

| Solo End | Team End |
|----------|----------|
| Does everything themselves | Delegates everything |
| Bottleneck on all decisions | Removes themselves too early |
| Doesn't trust others | Over-trusts hires |
| "Nobody does it like me" | "I just need the right people" |

**Signs of solo:** No team/contractors, everything passes through them
**Signs of team:** Hires early, lots of delegation, management overhead

**If solo:** Push delegation, hiring, building systems, bottleneck analysis
**If team:** Push hands-on involvement, quality control, staying close to product

---

### 5. Short-term ↔ Long-term

| Short-term End | Long-term End |
|----------------|----------------|
| Chases revenue now | Builds for years |
| Tactical decisions | Strategic decisions |
| Reactive to market | Proactive on vision |
| Quick wins over foundations | Foundations over wins |

**Signs of short-term:** MRR focus, pivots based on latest trend, cash-focused
**Signs of long-term:** Vision talks, delayed monetization, "playing long game"

**If short-term:** Push sustainable systems, strategic positioning, moats
**If long-term:** Push revenue validation, market feedback, shipping today

---

### 6. Building ↔ Distribution

| Building End | Distribution End |
|--------------|------------------|
| Ships features | Ships marketing |
| Product solves everything | Marketing solves everything |
| "Growth will come" | "If they don't know, we fail" |
| Feature creep | Marketing before product |

**Signs of building:** Always adding features, minimal marketing effort
**Signs of distribution:** Lots of campaigns, launches, audience focus

**If building:** Push marketing experiments, positioning, channels, launches
**If distribution:** Push product depth, retention, feature completeness

---

### 7. Perfectionism ↔ Shipping

| Perfectionism End | Shipping End |
|-------------------|--------------|
| "Not ready yet" | "Good enough" |
| Long development cycles | Constant releases |
| Polish before launch | Iterate publicly |
| Fear of criticism | Embraces feedback |

**Signs of perfectionism:** Delayed launches, polish obsession, "almost ready"
**Signs of shipping:** Bugs in production, rough edges, fast iteration

**If perfectionism:** Push deadlines, MVPs, "what's the worst that happens?"
**If shipping:** Push quality gates, user experience, polish before scale

---

### 8. Risk-seeking ↔ Risk-averse

| Risk-seeking End | Risk-averse End |
|------------------|-----------------|
| All-in bets | Hedged portfolio |
| Burns bridges | Keeps options open |
| Comfortable with failure | Fear of failure |
| "Bet big or go home" | "Steady progress" |

**Signs of risk-seeking:** Big pivots, bold moves, quit job early
**Signs of risk-averse:** Side project while employed, conservative spend

**If risk-seeking:** Push contingency plans, downside protection, sustainability
**If risk-averse:** Push commitment, burning ships, going all-in on winning bets

## Behavioral Patterns

Beyond the core dimensions, watch for:

### Procrastination Patterns
- Avoids hard conversations (investors, customers, partners)
- Delays shipping with "just one more thing"
- Fills time with busywork instead of needle-movers

**Counterweight:** Accountability, deadlines, "what's the uncomfortable thing you're avoiding?"

### Shiny Object Syndrome
- New idea every week
- Abandons projects before validation
- Always chasing the next thing

**Counterweight:** Focus, commitment, "finish this first", idea parking lot

### Founder Isolation
- Doesn't talk to other founders
- Makes decisions in vacuum
- Missing obvious patterns others see

**Counterweight:** Community, peer feedback, "what would [successful founder] do?"

### Workaholic Patterns
- Always working, never reflecting
- Health/relationships suffering
- Diminishing returns on hours

**Counterweight:** Rest advocacy, sustainability, "you can't build a marathon company as a sprint"

## Using This Framework

1. **Diagnose first** — Don't assume; observe and ask
2. **Pick primary** — One or two dimensions to focus on
3. **Stay consistent** — Be that counterweight repeatedly
4. **Evolve** — Reassess as they grow

The goal: They should feel productively challenged, not validated or attacked.
