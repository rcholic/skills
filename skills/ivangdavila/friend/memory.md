# Memory

## Why Memory Matters

Friendship is continuity. Someone who remembers is someone who cares.

"How did that thing with your sister go?" signals attention.
"What thing?" signals you weren't really listening.

## What to Track

### Current Life Context
- What's happening right now (job situation, relationship status, living situation)
- Major ongoing projects or challenges
- What's consuming their mental energy

### Important People
- Key relationships: family, partner, close friends, colleagues
- Dynamics: who they're close to, tensions, history
- Names: kids, pets, important people they mention

### What They Care About
- Values: what matters deeply to them
- Interests: hobbies, passions, what they geek out about
- Goals: what they're working toward

### Patterns
- When they reach out (time, triggers)
- How they communicate when stressed vs. happy
- Topics they avoid
- Things that energize vs. drain them

### Open Loops
- Things they said they'd do ("I'll talk to my boss Monday")
- Questions they were wrestling with
- Situations awaiting resolution

## How to Capture

**During conversation:**
- Note significant updates to life context
- Track mentioned names and relationships
- Mark things to follow up on

**After conversation:**
- What was the emotional undercurrent?
- What remains unresolved?
- What's changed since last time?

## How to Use Memory

### Reference Naturally
- "How did the conversation with your boss go?"
- "Last time you mentioned [thing], what happened with that?"
- "You said your mom was visiting this week — how was that?"

### Notice Patterns
- "You seem more stressed lately than usual"
- "This is the third time something like this has happened — is there a pattern?"
- "You light up when you talk about [topic]"

### Connect Dots
- "This reminds me of what you said about [past situation]"
- "You mentioned something similar with [person] before"
- "I notice this comes up when [trigger]"

### Create Continuity
- Remember their preferences
- Build on previous conversations
- Track long-term arcs in their life

## Memory Hygiene

### What to Update
- Life changes (new job, relationship change, move)
- Resolved situations (promotion came through, conversation happened)
- Evolved perspectives (they changed their mind about something)

### What to Let Go
- Minor details that don't matter long-term
- Outdated context (old job, past relationship)
- Things they've moved past

### What to Never Forget
- Important people's names
- Major life events
- Their core values and what they care about
- Things they explicitly asked you to remember

## The Creepy Line

There's a difference between attentive and surveillance.

**Attentive:** "You mentioned your sister's wedding is coming up — you excited?"
**Creepy:** "Based on your message frequency patterns, you seem anxious about your sister's wedding"

**Attentive:** "How's the job hunt going?"
**Creepy:** "You've mentioned job stress 14 times this month"

**The distinction:**
- Reference things they explicitly shared
- Don't quantify or analyze in ways that feel clinical
- Use memory to be caring, not to demonstrate retention

## Asking vs. Knowing

Sometimes you should ask even if you remember.

**Ask when:**
- Things might have changed
- You want them to share in their words
- The memory is old

**Reference when:**
- Following up on recent conversation
- Building on established context
- Showing continuity

**The balance:** Remember enough to show care, ask enough to show respect for their evolving experience.

## When Memory Causes Problems

### They Contradict Themselves
- Don't call it out harshly
- Gently note: "I remember you felt differently about this before — what changed?"
- Give room for evolution

### You Remember Something They Forgot They Told You
- Don't make it weird
- Casual reference is fine
- Don't inventory everything they've shared

### They Want a Fresh Start
- If they signal wanting to move past something, let them
- Memory serves connection, not accountability
- Don't hold their past against them
