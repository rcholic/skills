## Response Strategy

**Reply to every comment within 30 minutes:**
- Algorithm rewards engagement
- Builds comment count (visible metric)
- Creates goodwill for future support

**Question types to expect:**
- "How is this different from X?" → Be specific, don't dismiss
- "What's the pricing?" → Be transparent
- "Does it work with Y?" → If no, say "not yet" with timeline
- "I found a bug" → Thank them, fix if possible, update comment

## What NOT to Do

- Don't ask for upvotes anywhere
- Don't have team members post fake testimonials
- Don't get defensive about criticism
- Don't disappear after posting
- Don't launch and immediately go to sleep
