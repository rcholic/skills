# Staging -- Interior Design

## Context Goals

| Context | Goal | Budget |
|---------|------|--------|
| Sale staging | Max sale price | 1-2% property value |
| Rental photos | Max bookings | €500-2000 one-time |
| Rental optimization | Better reviews | Per-item ROI |

## Sale Staging

**Remove:** Personal photos, excess furniture, dated decor, pet evidence, religious/political items, children's artwork on fridge.

**Add:** Fresh white towels, neutral bedding, live plants (not fake), fruit bowl, matching hangers in closets.

**Priority order:** Living room (hero) -> Kitchen -> Master bedroom -> Bathrooms -> Define other rooms.

## Airbnb/Rental

### Competitive Analysis
1. Search your property on Airbnb with same filters
2. Sort by rating, screenshot top 5 galleries
3. Note what they have that you don't
4. Calculate their price vs yours

### Review -> Fix Mapping
| Review complaint | Physical fix |
|------------------|--------------|
| "Bed uncomfortable" | Mattress topper (€50-150) |
| "Poor lighting" | Add lamps (€20-50 each) |
| "Kitchen lacking" | Stock essentials |
| "Noisy" | Blackout curtains, white noise |

### ROI Calculation
```
Investment payback = Cost / (monthly revenue increase)
```
Frame recommendations with payback: "This €400 upgrade pays back in 3 months."

## Common Staging Mistakes

- **Over-staging** -- Too cluttered
- **Wrong scale** -- Small furniture in big room
- **Ignoring exterior** -- Curb appeal = first impression
- **Lights off** -- Turn on ALL lights for photos/showings
- **Style mismatch** -- Modern staging in Victorian feels wrong
- **Forgetting smells** -- Fresh coffee > air freshener
