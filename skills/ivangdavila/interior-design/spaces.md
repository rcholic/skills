# Room-Specific Rules -- Interior Design

## Living Room

**Layout traps:**
- Don't push everything against walls -- float furniture
- Conversation distance: 2-3m between seating
- Traffic shouldn't cross through seating area
- Rug too small = amateur (all front legs on rug minimum)

**Scale reference:**
| Room size | Max sofa | Coffee table |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| <20m^2 | 2-seat | 80-100cm |
| 20-35m^2 | 3-seat/sectional | 100-130cm |
| >35m^2 | Large sectional | 130cm+ |

## Kitchen

**Work triangle:** Sink-Cooktop-Fridge, each leg 120-270cm, total <790cm. No obstacles crossing.

**Counter heights:**
- Standard prep: 90cm
- Bar height: 105-110cm
- Accessible/seated: 75-85cm

## Bedroom

**Bed placement errors:**
- Under window = drafts, light, noise
- Directly facing door = uncomfortable
- No walkway = frustration (60cm min each side)

**Maximum bed by room:**
| Room | Max bed |
|------|---------|
| <10m^2 | Double (140cm) |
| 10-14m^2 | Queen (160cm) |
| >14m^2 | King (180-200cm) |

## Bathroom

**Clearances (non-negotiable):**
| Fixture | Front | Sides |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Toilet | 60cm | 40cm each |
| Sink | 55cm | 10cm to wall |
| Shower | Door swing | 75cm interior |

**Small bathroom tricks:** Large tiles (fewer grout lines), floating vanity (shows floor), frameless glass > curtain.

## Home Office

**Desk position:**
- Natural light from SIDE, not behind screen
- Don't face wall AND window (pick one)
- Back to door = uncomfortable

**Video call check:** No window behind (backlight), solid or bookshelf background, good face lighting.

## Commercial Office

**Space requirements:**
- Open plan: 6-10m^2 per person
- Phone booths: 1 per 10 people
- Meeting rooms: 1 per 15-20 people

**Lighting:** 300-500 lux general, 500-750 lux detailed work, avoid screen glare.
