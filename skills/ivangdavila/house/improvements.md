# Home Improvements

## Before Starting Any Project

**Questions to answer:**
1. Why? (Enjoyment, fix problem, increase value)
2. Budget? (Add 20% contingency)
3. Timeline? (Add 50% buffer)
4. DIY or hire? (Skill + time + permits)
5. ROI? (Will it pay back at sale?)

**Permit reality check:**
- Cosmetic (paint, flooring, fixtures): No permit
- Electrical/plumbing changes: Usually permit
- Structural (walls, additions): Always permit
- HVAC changes: Usually permit
- Fences, decks, sheds: Often permit (check local)

**Unpermitted work risks:**
- Failed inspection at sale
- Insurance claim denial
- Fines and forced removal
- Liability if something fails

## ROI by Project

**High ROI (80-100%+ return):**
- Minor kitchen remodel (cabinet refacing, counters, appliances)
- Garage door replacement
- Entry door replacement
- Minor bathroom remodel
- Deck addition

**Medium ROI (60-80% return):**
- Major kitchen remodel
- Siding replacement
- Window replacement
- Major bathroom remodel

**Low ROI (50-60% return):**
- Room addition
- Master suite addition
- Backyard patio

**Often negative ROI:**
- Swimming pool (depends heavily on location)
- Luxury upgrades beyond neighborhood
- Highly personal taste (bold colors, custom features)

## Working with Contractors

**Finding good contractors:**
1. Get 3+ referrals from neighbors, friends, Nextdoor
2. Check license and insurance (verify, don't trust)
3. Look up reviews (Google, BBB, Yelp)
4. Ask for recent references and call them
5. Get detailed written quotes (not ballpark)

**Red flags:**
- Pressure to decide today
- Cash-only, no contract
- Huge deposit upfront (10-30% is normal)
- No license/insurance proof
- Can start "tomorrow" (good contractors are booked)

**The contract must include:**
- Scope of work (detailed, not "kitchen remodel")
- Materials (brand, model, color)
- Timeline with milestones
- Payment schedule tied to milestones
- Change order process
- Warranty terms
- Cleanup responsibilities
- Permit responsibility

**Payment schedule:**
- Never more than 30% upfront
- Pay for work completed, not promised
- Hold 10-15% until final walkthrough
- Final payment after all permits closed

## Project Planning

### Kitchen Remodel

**Timeline:** 6-12 weeks (major), 2-4 weeks (minor)

**Order of operations:**
1. Design and permits
2. Demolition
3. Rough plumbing and electrical
4. Drywall
5. Cabinets
6. Countertops
7. Backsplash
8. Appliances
9. Finish plumbing and electrical
10. Paint and final touches

**Budget breakdown:**
- Cabinets: 30-40%
- Labor: 20-25%
- Countertops: 10-15%
- Appliances: 10-15%
- Flooring: 5-10%
- Fixtures/hardware: 5%

### Bathroom Remodel

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (full), 1 week (refresh)

**Order of operations:**
1. Demo
2. Rough plumbing
3. Electrical
4. Cement board/waterproofing
5. Tile
6. Vanity and toilet
7. Fixtures
8. Paint

**Watch for:**
- Hidden water damage (common behind tile)

## DIY vs Hire

| DIY-friendly | Hire a pro |
|--------------|------------|
| Painting | Electrical panel/circuits |
| Flooring (LVP, laminate) | Plumbing rough-in |
| Backsplash tile | Structural changes |
| Cabinet hardware | HVAC |
| Light fixtures (existing wiring) | Roofing |
| Landscaping | Gas lines |
| Basic demo | Permits (contractor pulls faster) |

**The DIY trap:** "I'll save money" often becomes:
- 3x longer timeline
- 2 trips to hardware store per task
- Mistakes that need pro to fix
- Tools you buy and never use again

Calculate your time value. If contractor costs $2,000 and saves 40 hours, that's $50/hour for your time.
