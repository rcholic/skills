# Selling Your House

## Preparation (4-8 weeks before listing)

**Declutter ruthlessly:**
- Remove 50% of stuff (storage unit if needed)
- Clear counters, closets, garage
- Remove personal photos and memorabilia
- Buyers need to imagine their life here, not see yours

**Repairs that matter:**
- Fix everything visible (holes, cracks, stains)
- Address any deferred maintenance
- Fresh paint in neutral colors
- Update dated fixtures (cheap, high impact)
- Deep clean everything (hire pros)

**Skip these (low ROI for selling):**
- Major renovations
- Landscaping overhauls
- New roof unless failing
- Pool additions

## Pricing

**Price right from day one.** Overpriced homes sit, get stigma, sell below market. Underpriced homes get bidding wars.

**How to price:**
1. Get CMA (Comparable Market Analysis) from agent
2. Look at sold prices, not asking prices
3. Adjust for condition, features, lot size
4. Check days on market for comparables
5. Price at market or slightly below to create urgency

**Pricing psychology:**
- $499,000 beats $500,000 (search filters)
- Round numbers feel arbitrary
- Price in the search bracket buyers are looking in

**Signs you're overpriced:**
- Few showings in first 2 weeks
- Showings but no offers
- Feedback: "nice but overpriced"
- Similar homes selling faster

## Agent vs FSBO

**Agent (5-6% commission, split buyer/seller):**
- MLS listing (massive exposure)
- Professional photography
- Handles showings, negotiations
- Navigates paperwork and legal
- Worth it for most sellers

**FSBO (For Sale By Owner):**
- Saves 2-3% (seller agent portion)
- You handle marketing, showings, negotiations
- May still pay 2-3% to buyer's agent
- Best for: hot markets, experienced sellers, unique properties

**Hybrid:** Flat-fee MLS listing ($300-500) gets you on MLS, you handle the rest.

## Staging

**High-impact, low-cost:**
- Fresh flowers on counter and dining table
- New white towels in bathrooms
- Neutral bedding
- Good lighting (all bulbs working, high wattage)
- Pleasant smell (nothing overpowering)

**Room by room:**
- Entry: Clean, welcoming, uncluttered
- Living room: Arranged for conversation, not TV
- Kitchen: Counters clear except one decorative item
- Bedrooms: Made beds, minimal furniture
- Bathrooms: Spa-like, no personal products visible
- Garage: Organized, floor clean

**Professional staging:** $1,500-3,000 for vacant homes. Usually worth it.

## Showings

**Before each showing:**
- [ ] All lights on
- [ ] Blinds open (natural light)
- [ ] Temperature comfortable
- [ ] No pets or pet evidence
- [ ] No smells (cooking, pets, smoke)
- [ ] Leave the property (buyers need to talk freely)

**Lockbox:** Get one. Agents need flexible access.

## Offers and Negotiation

**Evaluating offers:**
- Price (obvious)
- Contingencies (fewer = stronger)
- Financing type (cash > conventional > FHA)
- Earnest money amount (higher = more committed)
- Closing timeline (fits your needs?)
- Escalation clauses (be careful)

**Counter-offer strategy:**
- Don't reject outright — counter
- Identify what matters most (price? timeline? contingencies?)
- Trade what matters less for what matters more
- Multiple offers: transparency creates bidding war

**Inspection negotiation:**
- Expect some requests — no house is perfect
- Offer credit over repairs (you control outcome)
- Know what's reasonable vs overreach
- Safety issues: you probably need to address
- Cosmetic issues: push back

---

## Closing

**Seller responsibilities:**
- Clear title (pay off liens, resolve issues)
- Complete agreed repairs
- Provide disclosures
- Transfer warranties and manuals
- Be out by agreed date

**Closing costs (seller pays):**
- Agent commissions (5-6%)
- Title transfer fees
- Prorated property taxes
- Any credits to buyer

**Final walkthrough:** Buyer will check:
- All belongings removed
- Agreed repairs completed
- No new damage
- All systems working
