# Buying a House

## Before You Search

**Financial readiness checklist:**
- [ ] Credit score 700+ (620 minimum for most loans, but costs more)
- [ ] Down payment saved (20% avoids PMI, but 3-5% programs exist)
- [ ] 6 months expenses in emergency fund AFTER down payment
- [ ] Debt-to-income under 43% (all monthly debts / gross income)
- [ ] Pre-approval letter in hand (not pre-qualification — actual pre-approval)

**True monthly cost = PITI + maintenance:**
- Principal + Interest + Taxes + Insurance
- Add 1% of home value per year for maintenance ($300k home = $250/month)
- Add HOA if applicable
- Add PMI if under 20% down

## The Search

**Must-haves vs nice-to-haves:** List 5 non-negotiables. Everything else is tradeable. Common non-negotiables: location, bedroom count, garage, lot size, school district.

**Red flags to walk away:**
- Foundation cracks (horizontal worse than vertical)
- Water stains on ceiling/walls (roof or plumbing issues)
- Musty smell (mold, hidden water damage)
- DIY electrical (exposed wiring, amateur panels)
- Neighborhood in decline (check crime stats, school ratings, business closures)

**Questions to ask:**
- Why are they selling? (Divorce, relocation = motivated. Investment flip = markup.)
- How long on market? (90+ days = negotiation leverage)
- Any offers? (Multiple = less leverage)
- What's included? (Appliances, fixtures, window treatments)

## Making Offers

**Price strategy:**
- Hot market: At or above asking, fewer contingencies
- Normal market: 5-10% below asking, standard contingencies
- Cold market: 15-20% below asking, all contingencies

**Contingencies to include:**
- Inspection (always, never waive)
- Financing (unless cash buyer)
- Appraisal (protects you if bank values lower)
- Sale of current home (weakens offer but sometimes necessary)

**Escalation clause:** "I offer $X, but will beat any higher offer by $Y up to $Z." Use in competitive markets.

## Inspection

**Never skip inspection.** Even in hot markets, make offer contingent on inspection. You can waive repair requests, but know what you're buying.

**Inspector finds issues — now what:**
1. Categorize: Safety (must fix) vs Maintenance (negotiate) vs Cosmetic (ignore)
2. Get contractor quotes for safety issues
3. Request: Seller fixes, credit at closing, or price reduction
4. Know your walk-away point before negotiating

**What inspection doesn't cover:**
- Inside walls (mold, pests, wiring)
- Sewer line condition (get separate scope)
- Well/septic (get separate tests)
- Pool/spa (specialist inspection)

---

## Closing

**Timeline:** Typically 30-45 days from accepted offer to keys.

**Closing costs (2-5% of purchase price):**
- Loan origination (0.5-1%)
- Appraisal ($300-500)
- Title insurance ($1,000-2,000)
- Attorney/escrow fees ($500-1,500)
- Prepaid taxes and insurance (varies)

**Final walkthrough (day before or morning of):**
- [ ] All agreed repairs completed
- [ ] Appliances working
- [ ] No new damage
- [ ] Seller's belongings removed
- [ ] Utilities on

**At closing:**
- Bring government ID and cashier's check
- Review every page (ask questions)
- You'll sign 50+ documents
- Get copies of everything
