## Content Updates

### When to Update

- Technology version changes (new release of tool/framework)
- Best practices evolve
- Student feedback identifies confusion
- Competitor courses cover something you don't
- External links break

### Update Process

1. Identify what needs updating
2. Decide: reshoot, append, or add supplementary content
3. Update course description if scope changes
4. Announce update to enrolled students

### Content Freshness Alerts

Track these for your topics:
- Version releases of tools/frameworks covered
- Industry news affecting content
- New competing courses
- Changes to platform policies

## Analytics Interpretation

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Completion rate | Course pacing/engagement |
| Lecture drop-off | Where students lose interest |
| Average rating | Overall satisfaction |
| Review velocity | Growth/momentum |
| Q&A volume | Content clarity |

### Action Triggers

- Completion <30%: Review pacing, consider restructuring

## Scaling Operations

### Managing Multiple Courses

- Unified tracking system (spreadsheet or tool)
- Scheduled review time (weekly Q&A, monthly analytics)
- Template responses for common questions
- Batch content updates (record multiple courses same day)

### Portfolio Strategy

- Build learning paths (beginner → advanced)
- Cross-promote related courses
- Bundle for higher cart value
- Retire underperformers
