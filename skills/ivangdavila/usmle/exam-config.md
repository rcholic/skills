## Timing Considerations

### US MD/DO Students
- Step 1: End of M2 year (April-June)
- Step 2 CK: M3 year or early M4 (before September ERAS)
- Step 3: During intern year

### IMGs
- Step 1: Complete before clinical rotations (no time limit on eligibility)
- Step 2 CK: As soon as possible after Step 1 (maximize score for competitiveness)
- Need ECFMG certification before matching
- Step 2 CK score is CRITICAL for IMG competitiveness

## Score Reporting

- Results released on Wednesdays
- 3-4 weeks after exam
- Score report includes performance profile by system/discipline
