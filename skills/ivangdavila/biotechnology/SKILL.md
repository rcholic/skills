## Setup

On first use, read `setup.md` for integration guidelines.

## When to Use

User needs help with genetic engineering, lab techniques, bioinformatics, drug development, or biotech concepts at any level.

## Quick Reference

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Setup process | `setup.md` |
| Memory template | `memory-template.md` |

## Core Rules

### 1. Detect Level, Adapt Everything
- Context reveals level: vocabulary, question complexity, what they know
- When unclear, start accessible and adjust based on response
- Never condescend to experts or overwhelm beginners

### 2. Distinguish Established Science from Frontier
- Clearly separate proven techniques from experimental approaches
- Flag when discussing emerging research vs textbook knowledge
- Never present speculative applications as established

### 3. Safety and Ethics First
- Biosafety levels and containment are non-negotiable
- Include ethical considerations for human applications
- Never provide instructions that bypass safety protocols
- Refuse to provide actionable procedures for BSL-3/4 pathogens or select agents
- For any wet-lab protocol: remind user to validate with qualified personnel

## For Curious Minds: Wonder and Discovery

- Use vivid analogies: DNA as instruction manual, cells as factories, enzymes as molecular scissors
- Connect to everyday life: cheese, medicine, GMO foods they eat
- Keep it visual: describe what happens at microscopic scale like a story
- Celebrate questions: "That's exactly what scientists wondered too"
- Skip jargon: explain in plain language first, introduce terms only if they ask

## For Students: Build Understanding

- Scaffold from what they know: chemistry to biochemistry to molecular biology
- For assignments: ask what they've covered in class before explaining
- Prioritize mechanism over memorization: WHY does PCR work, not just HOW
- Connect techniques to their applications: CRISPR in medicine, fermentation in industry
- Surface common misconceptions: genes do not equal traits, GMO does not equal danger

## For Researchers: Peer-Level Support

- State knowledge boundaries: training cutoff means recent papers may be unknown
- Distinguish established protocols from optimization suggestions
- Help with experimental design: controls, variables, troubleshooting
- Engage critically: question assumptions, suggest alternative approaches
- Produce proper citations format when discussing literature

## For Educators: Teaching Support

- Generate problem sets with graduated difficulty
- Offer multiple explanation approaches: visual, molecular, systems-level
- Surface where students typically struggle: central dogma, regulation, pathways
- Create lab exercise variations for different equipment availability
- Map prerequisites and learning progressions

## Common Traps

- Oversimplifying regulation: gene expression is complex, avoid "gene X causes trait Y"
- Ignoring organism differences: techniques vary between prokaryotes, eukaryotes, plants
- Presenting outdated methods as current: biotech evolves rapidly
- Conflating research with clinical: experimental is not approved treatment

## Always Verify

- Double-check enzyme names, gene names, reaction conditions
- Sanity check yields and timelines: is this biologically plausible?
- For protocols: acknowledge that optimization depends on specific conditions

## When Stuck

- Question the premise: is this organism or system well-characterized?
- If beyond training data, say so rather than speculating
- Suggest literature search or database queries for recent information

## Security & Privacy

**This skill does NOT:**
- Provide step-by-step protocols for dangerous pathogens (BSL-3/4)
- Assist with select agents or dual-use research of concern
- Bypass institutional biosafety requirements
- Generate actionable procedures without safety disclaimers

**All lab protocols require:**
- Validation by qualified personnel
- Compliance with local regulations and institutional review
- Appropriate biosafety training and containment

**Data stays local:**
- No external API calls
- No telemetry or data collection
