## Active Leads

### Sarah Chen @ TechBridge Solutions
- **Stage**: closing
- **Type**: Koala (patient, risk-averse, needs reassurance)
- **Score**: 88
- **Status**: 🟢 Green
- **Deal Size**: $8,500
- **Last Contact**: 2026-02-22
- **Next Action**: Follow up on proposal — reassure with case study — get YES/NO by Feb 26
- **Key Pain**: Current supplier is unreliable, causing production delays
- **Notes**: Very thorough decision-maker. Needs to feel 100% safe before committing.
  Her boss (Tiger) will sign off, but she recommends. Win her heart first.
  Sent proposal Feb 20. She said "looks good" but needs to review with team.

### David Park @ Sunrise Manufacturing
- **Stage**: negotiation
- **Type**: Tiger (direct, impatient, results-focused)
- **Score**: 76
- **Status**: 🟡 Yellow (5 days since last contact — rhythm slipping)
- **Deal Size**: $22,000
- **Last Contact**: 2026-02-19
- **Next Action**: Direct call TODAY — ask "where are we on the final number?" — max 5 min
- **Key Pain**: Manual procurement process costing 3 hrs/day per buyer (6 buyers)
- **Notes**: He ran the numbers himself: $180K/year in labor cost just for procurement.
  Our solution pays back in 4 months. He knows the ROI — the holdup is IT approval.
  Don't over-explain. He hates it. One direct question per call.

### Wei Lin @ FastGrow Retail
- **Stage**: qualified
- **Type**: Owl (analytical, needs data, asks many questions)
- **Score**: 61
- **Status**: 🟢 Green
- **Deal Size**: $5,200
- **Last Contact**: 2026-02-21
- **Next Action**: Demo scheduled Feb 27 — prepare complete spec sheet + 3 competitor comparison tables
- **Key Pain**: Can't reconcile inventory data across 5 warehouse locations
- **Notes**: Asked 14 questions in the discovery call. That's a good sign — Owls who
  aren't interested don't bother asking. She will ask for a detailed spec before
  committing. Have the data ready before she asks.

### Marcus Chen @ RetailCo Group
- **Stage**: presented
- **Type**: Peacock (social, relationship-driven, status-conscious)
- **Score**: 34
- **Status**: 🔴 Red (12 days since last contact — URGENT)
- **Deal Size**: $15,000
- **Last Contact**: 2026-02-12
- **Next Action**: URGENT — send a warm re-engagement today before water goes cold
- **Key Pain**: Wants to be the "first in their industry" to use AI for procurement
- **Notes**: Demo went well, he was excited. Then went quiet. Classic Peacock pattern —
  got distracted by something shiny. Re-engage with a story about a competitor
  doing something similar. His FOMO is the lever.
  Message: "Marcus — I was just thinking about you. One of your industry
  competitors just moved forward with something very similar to what we discussed.
  Thought you'd want to know. 15 mins this week?"

### Emma Zhang @ BlueSky Trading
- **Stage**: connected
- **Type**: Unknown — first call next week
- **Score**: 45
- **Status**: 🟢 Green
- **Deal Size**: TBD
- **Last Contact**: 2026-02-23
- **Next Action**: Discovery call Feb 28 — focus on 挖需求 (uncover pain), 70% listen
- **Key Pain**: Unknown — she mentioned "scaling issues" but didn't elaborate
- **Notes**: Warm intro from a mutual contact. She was receptive on first call.
  Next call: ask 3 open questions, shut up and listen. Don't pitch until
  pain is clearly articulated.
  Personality type detection: observe how she opens the call.
  Quick and direct = Tiger. Warm and chatty = Peacock. Cautious = Koala. Detailed = Owl.
