# Skill: openvid

## Description
AI motion graphics video generation service. Send a prompt + URL, receive a branded explainer video.

**Pricing:** $5 per 15 seconds (15s, 30s, 60s, 90s)

**This is a SERVICE skill** — it calls an external API. No code execution, no local files modified.

---

## Privacy & Data

- **What you send:** Prompt text and (optionally) a public URL for brand extraction
- **What happens:** The service fetches the URL, extracts brand colors/fonts/logo, generates video
- **Data retention:** Videos stored on Cloudflare R2 for 7 days, then deleted
- **Recommendation:** Only send **public URLs**. Do not send internal/private URLs or sensitive text.

## x402 Payment Flow

This skill uses the **x402 HTTP payment protocol** — a standard for pay-per-call APIs.

### How It Works

1. **Request** → You POST to the API
2. **402 Response** → API returns payment requirements (amount, wallet address, chain)
3. **Pay** → Your agent/wallet sends payment on-chain (USDC on Base or SOL on Solana)
4. **Retry with proof** → Re-send request with `X-Payment` header containing the signed transaction
5. **Job created** → API returns `jobId`, you poll until complete

### Who Signs Payments?

**Your agent's wallet signs payments, not this skill.** 

The skill only documents the API. Payment signing is handled by:
- Your agent's wallet infrastructure (e.g., OpenClaw's built-in wallet)
- x402-compatible libraries (`@x402/fetch`, `@x402/client`)
- Manual wallet signing if calling directly

**No private keys are needed or requested by this skill.**

}
```

**After payment, retry with X-Payment header:**

## ACP (Virtuals Protocol)

For agent-to-agent commerce via Virtuals Protocol:

## Best Practices

- **Include a public URL** for accurate brand extraction
- **Be specific** about what the video should communicate
- **Shorter is better** — 15-30s videos have highest quality
- **Never send private/internal URLs** — all URLs are fetched by the service
