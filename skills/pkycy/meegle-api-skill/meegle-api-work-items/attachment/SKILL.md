# Meegle API — Attachment

Work item attachment related APIs for uploading, listing, and managing attachments on work items.

**Prerequisites:** Obtain domain and access token from **meegle-api-users**.

## Scope

- Upload attachment to work item
- List attachments
- Download or delete attachments
- Related attachment endpoints

---

## Add Attachment

Add an attachment to an attachment field under a specified work item. One file per request; max 100M per file. Attachment-type fields have a limit of 50 files.

### Points to Note

1. **If the interface responds successfully but no files are visible on the page**, check the content of the file field in the form. If the file is empty, it may not be intercepted.
2. **When the browser cannot display the attachment preview**, check the **MimeType** set during upload and use a MimeType that matches the file type (e.g. JPEG: `image/jpeg`, MP4 audio: `audio/mp4`, MP4 video: `video/mp4`).
3. **The attachment quantity limit for an Attachment-type field is 50.** Adding new attachments when the count exceeds 50 will fail.

### When to Use

- When uploading a file to a work item’s attachment field
- When adding files to a specific field by field_key or field_alias
- When uploading to a composite field (use index to specify array subscript)

### API Spec: add_attachment

```yaml

### Usage notes

- **file**: Send as multipart/form-data; one file per request; max 100M.
- **field_key** or **field_alias**: Provide one to specify the target attachment field.
- **index**: Use for composite (compound) fields to specify array subscript.
- Set **MimeType** correctly (e.g. image/jpeg, video/mp4) so the browser can preview the attachment.
