# Meegle API — Group

Work item group related APIs for organizing and managing work item groups.

**Prerequisites:** Obtain domain and access token from **meegle-api-users**.

## Scope

- Create, list, update work item groups
- Group membership and hierarchy
- Related group endpoints

---

## Invite BOTs into Groups

Add the specified Feishu robot to the group associated with the work item. The group must already exist and be bound to the work item.

### Points to Note

- **The Feishu Project bot must already be in the corresponding Feishu group** before using this interface.
- This interface **only supports adding the bot to the group associated with the work item** (not arbitrary groups).

### When to Use

- When inviting a Feishu/Lark bot into the work item’s associated group chat
- When automating group notifications or workflows for a work item’s group
- When the work item has an associated group and the bot needs to join it
