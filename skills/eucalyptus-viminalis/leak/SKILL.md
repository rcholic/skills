# leak (migration stub)

This legacy skill is now a compatibility stub.

Use the split hardened skills instead:
- `leak-buy` for buying and downloading content.
- `leak-publish` for publishing and selling content.

## Migration

1. Install `leak-buy` when the user asks to buy/download.
2. Install `leak-publish` when the user asks to publish/sell.
3. Do not execute buy/publish workflows from this stub.

## Rationale

The split model reduces risk surface, removes mixed high-risk behavior from one skill, and hardens scanner posture for Clawhub.
