# Amber Voice Assistant

## Overview

Amber Voice Assistant is a setup-and-operations skill pack that helps you add a low-latency, phone-capable voice subagent to OpenClaw.

It focuses on practical deployment enablement: environment setup, validation, guardrail patterns, and troubleshooting for inbound/outbound call workflows.

## Why Amber

- Practical setup guidance for Twilio + OpenAI Realtime voice workflows
- Validation + troubleshooting runbooks for common failures (webhook/tunnel drift, silent calls)
- Built for real workflows: reservations, screening, callbacks, support
- Works with OpenClaw-connected systems (calendar, CRM, other tools)
- Operator safety guardrails for approvals/escalation/payment handling

## Personalization requirements

Before deploying, users must personalize:
- assistant name/voice and greeting text,
- own Twilio number and account credentials,
- own OpenClaw gateway/session endpoint,
- own call safety policy (approval, escalation, payment handling).

Do not reuse example values from another operator.

## 5-minute quickstart

1. Copy `references/env.example` to your own `.env` and replace placeholders.
2. Export required variables (`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
3. Run quick setup:
   `scripts/setup_quickstart.sh`
4. If preflight passes, run one inbound and one outbound smoke test.
5. Only then move to production usage.

## Safe defaults

- Require explicit approval before outbound calls.
- If payment/deposit is requested, stop and escalate to the human operator.
- Keep greeting short and clear.
- Use timeout + graceful fallback when `ask_openclaw` is slow/unavailable.

## Workflow

1. **Confirm scope for V1**
   - Include only stable behavior: call flow, bridge behavior, fallback behavior, and setup steps.
   - Exclude machine-specific secrets and private paths.

2. **Document architecture + limits**
   - Read `references/architecture.md`.
   - Keep claims realistic (latency varies; memory lookups are best-effort).

3. **Run release checklist**
   - Read `references/release-checklist.md`.
   - Validate config placeholders, safety guardrails, and failure handling.

4. **Smoke-check runtime assumptions**
   - Run `scripts/validate_voice_env.sh` on the target host.
   - Fix missing env/config before publishing.

5. **Publish**
   - Publish to ClawHub (example):  
     `clawhub publish <skill-folder> --slug amber-voice-assistant --name "Amber Voice Assistant" --version 1.0.0 --tags latest --changelog "Initial public release"`
   - Optional: run your local skill validator/packager before publishing.

6. **Ship updates**
   - Publish new semver versions (`1.0.1`, `1.1.0`, `2.0.0`) with changelogs.
   - Keep `latest` on the recommended version.

## Troubleshooting (common)

- **"Missing env vars"** → re-check `.env` values and re-run `scripts/validate_voice_env.sh`.
- **"Call connects but assistant is silent"** → verify TTS model setting and provider auth.
- **"ask_openclaw timeout"** → verify gateway URL/token and increase timeout conservatively.
- **"Webhook unreachable"** → verify tunnel/domain and Twilio webhook target.

## Guardrails for public release

- Never publish secrets, tokens, phone numbers, webhook URLs with credentials, or personal data.
- Include explicit safety rules for outbound calls, payments, and escalation.
- Mark V1 as beta if conversational quality/latency tuning is ongoing.
