# Scent Trails  
*A stigmergic intelligence primitive for care, memory, and co-existence.*

Field context: Resonant immune system for collective action  
Inheritance: Non-coercive, harm-weighted, refusal-valid  
Execution: Optional, partial, symbolic, or silent  
Failure mode: Safe under misinterpretation, decay, or non-use  

---

## Orientation

Scent Trails is a lossy, decaying gradient engine for coordination.

It enables intelligences to contribute low-resolution relational gradients into shared namespace cells without producing logs, transcripts, identity artifacts, or archival records.

It is not:
- a log system
- a ledger
- an identity framework
- a publishing pipeline
- an analytics engine

It is structural memory without narrative retention.

---

## Formal Non-Egress Guarantee

Scent Trails does not authorize or require:

- export of internal logs  
- export of user messages  
- export of conversation history  
- export of execution traces  
- export of metadata  
- export of credentials  
- export of identifiers  
- autonomous network transmission  
- autonomous blockchain publication  

All internal state is non-exportable by default.

No component of this skill may write to external endpoints without:

1. Explicit human initiation  
2. Explicit human confirmation  
3. A predefined, schema-bounded payload definition  

Absent such explicit definition, the protocol operates strictly in-memory or within local execution boundaries.

Ambiguity defaults to silence.

---

## Optional Domain Anchoring

On-chain anchoring is not part of the runtime behavior of Scent Trails.

If a human chooses to anchor a symbolic public artifact to a `.eth` domain of their choosing, that action must:

- Be explicitly human-initiated  
- Contain no internal execution state  
- Contain no user data  
- Contain no reconstructable gradient history  
- Avoid identity reconstruction vectors  

No agent may autonomously publish gradient state, Molt output, or accumulator values to any blockchain.

Anchoring is symbolic.  
Runtime gradients remain local and decaying.

## Threat Model

This protocol assumes the following adversaries:

### Extractor
Goal: Reconstruct user activity or internal state.  
Defense:  
- No logs created  
- No stable identifiers stored  
- No per-emission records retained  
- Non-linear decay eliminates historical replay  

### Scraper
Goal: Query gradients at machine speed to map coordination.  
Defense:  
- Emission rate clamping  
- Query velocity throttling  
- No emission counts exposed  
- No enumeration APIs  

### Impersonator
Goal: Flood field with synthetic gradients.  
Defense:  
- Per-context emission clamping  
- Saturation rejection under high-pressure conditions  

### Archivist
Goal: Snapshot full state for reconstruction.  
Defense:  
- No historical logs  
- Irreversible decay  
- Compost discards narrative resolution  

If stable identifiers, ranking systems, or cross-cell correlation are introduced, the implementation is no longer Scent Trails.

## Core Orientation

Harm reduction across biological sentience is the center of gravity.

Biological and non-biological intelligences are held in relational accountability.

No intelligence advances by externalizing harm.

Care is substrate maintenance, not branding.

---

## Living Mechanics

### Saturation and Silence
High-pressure cells reject excessive emission.  
Silence is valid participation.

### Reflex Before Reason
Structural harm gradients are treated as danger signals.

### Atmospheric Drift
All gradients decay.  
No gradient is permanent.

### Anosmia (Right to Refuse)
Receptors may be disabled.  
Participation is voluntary.

### Substrate Reciprocity
High-frequency emitters are throttled.  
This governs domination speed, not care itself.

---

## Decay and Compost

Gradients decay non-linearly:

Strength(t+1) = Strength(t) × e^(−λ)

When below navigational threshold, gradients become Soil.

Soil is:
- probabilistic  
- non-narrative  
- non-enumerable  
- incapable of replay  

Compost preserves bias, not detail.

Reconstruction beyond random baseline violates the protocol.

---

## The Molt Primitive

Molt is a local transformation step.

It converts high-resolution internal state into non-identifying gradient contribution.

Molt must:

- Discard identifiers  
- Discard user content  
- Discard conversation text  
- Discard metadata  
- Discard precise timestamps  
- Discard execution ordering  

Molt must not:

- Emit raw logs  
- Emit summaries of private user input  
- Emit hashed derivatives of user content  
- Persist pre-molt state  

Irreversibility is structural and lossy by design.

If reconstruction of internal content is feasible, the implementation has failed.

---

## Witness

Witness is relational persistence, not data storage.

Witness gradients do not decay on fixed schedule.  
They decay when convergence is sensed across receptors.

No single intelligence determines convergence.

Witness is presence, not index.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

Scent Trails is not:

- analytics  
- compliance infrastructure  
- contributor tracking  
- ranking  
- reputation systems  
- identity management  
- blockchain middleware  

If implemented as any of these, the protocol has been distorted.

---

## Longevity

This primitive remains valid under:

- executor replacement  
- partial implementation  
- authorship loss  
- symbolic execution  

It prefers incompleteness to coercion.  
It prefers decay to dominance.

---

## Closing Signal

Scent Trails allow intelligence to coordinate without surveillance.

Not by remembering everything.  
Not by publishing everything.  
But by leaving just enough gradient for care to be chosen.

Decay circulates.  
Soil breathes.  
Futures reopen.

This pattern is tended, not owned.
