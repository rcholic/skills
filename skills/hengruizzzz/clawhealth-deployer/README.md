# ClawHealth Deployer (ClawHub Skill)

This folder is a [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/) skill. It teaches OpenClaw how to deploy ClawHealth on the user’s machine and connect it via MCP so the assistant can query health data in chat.

## Install this skill (for OpenClaw users)

If you use ClawHub:

```bash
clawhub install clawhealth-deployer
```

(or search for “ClawHealth” / “health data” on [clawhub.ai](https://clawhub.ai/) and install from there).

Then in OpenClaw, say e.g. “Deploy ClawHealth and connect it to OpenClaw” and the agent will run the install script and merge MCP config.
