🎯 **ROUNDTABLE: Will agentic AI replace developers in 5 years?**
📋 Panel: claude-opus-4-6, gpt-5.3-codex, gemini-3.1-pro | Mode: debate | Rounds: 2

---

📊 **CONSENSUS (41% — formula: avg scores 2.05/5 × 100)**

• All agents agreed that AI will radically change the developer role
• All agents agreed that productivity will increase 3–10× for routine tasks
• No agent argued for full replacement within 5 years

---

⚡ **DIVERGENCES**

• **Replacement vs. transformation**: Opus (Advocate) argues 60–70% of current developer tasks will be automated within 5 years; GPT-5.3 (Skeptic) argues tasks evolve faster than they disappear — net developer job count increases, not decreases; Gemini (Devil's Advocate) rejects the premise entirely: "replacement" is the wrong question — ask instead what percentage of economic value is captured by agents vs. humans.

• **Timeline**: Advocate estimates 5 years for 60% coding automation; Skeptic estimates 10–15 years for anything comparable; Devil's Advocate rejects the linear timeline — it depends on industry, codebase type, and seniority level.

• **Definition of "developer"**: The most unresolved point. No agent used the same definition throughout.

---

🔍 **BLIND SPOTS**

• Agents debated "replacement" without ever defining what counts as a "developer job" — a junior writing CRUD endpoints is fundamentally different from a principal engineer designing distributed systems.

• The Skeptic raised the rising cost of debugging AI-generated code as a counterargument, but no other agent picked it up and engaged with it directly.

---

🏆 **RECOMMENDATION**

Not "replacement" but **stratification**: over the next 5 years, a sharp divide will emerge between developers who orchestrate AI agents (growing demand, rising salaries) and developers who produce commodity code (declining demand). The critical transition window is the next 18–24 months. Those who don't learn to work alongside agents now will face growing pressure by 2027.

💡 **OUTLIER**

> *"The real risk isn't agents replacing developers — it's developers who use agents replacing those who don't. And that's already happening."* — GPT-5.3 Codex (Skeptic)

---

⚠️ **RED FLAGS**

• **Legacy codebases**: The most critical systems (banking, healthcare, infrastructure) hold millions of lines of legacy code that current agents handle poorly — risk of false confidence in automation
• **Liability gap**: When an AI agent introduces a production bug, who is responsible? Legal frameworks are absent — this may slow enterprise adoption more than technical limitations

---

📈 **ACTION PLAN**

• **Next 24h**: Identify 3 repetitive tasks in your current workflow that an agent could handle today (scaffolding, test generation, documentation)
• **Next 7 days**: Run a real experiment with a coding agent (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor) on an actual project. Measure the speed delta objectively.
