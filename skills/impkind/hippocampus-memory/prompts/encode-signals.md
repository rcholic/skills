# Encoding Signals (DEPRECATED)

> **Note:** This prompt is deprecated. Encoding now happens automatically via:
> - `encode-pipeline.sh` — Preprocesses and scores signals
> - Encoding cron job — LLM sub-agent does semantic summarization and reinforcement

For the current encoding flow, see the hippocampus-encoding cron job.
