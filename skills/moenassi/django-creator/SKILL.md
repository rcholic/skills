This project eliminates the time wasted on creating virtual machines and setting up environments from scratch. It automatically provisions a ready-to-use development environment with commonly used default requirements, allowing you to choose between Django or Django REST Framework depending on your project needs.

The goal is to standardize and accelerate project initialization by providing a consistent, production-ready structure from day one. Instead of manually configuring dependencies, environments, and base settings, developers can instantly bootstrap a fully configured backend setup with best practices already applied.

- Key features include:

- Automated environment provisioning

- Preconfigured project structure following best practices

- Support for both Django and Django REST Framework

- Default development and production-ready settings

- Dependency management and isolated environments

- Scalable foundation suitable for small projects or large deployments

This solution is ideal for developers and teams who want to focus on building features rather than repeatedly performing boilerplate setup tasks. It reduces human error, improves consistency across projects, and significantly speeds up the development workflow
