# openclaw-agent-optimize-skill (DEPRECATED)

This ClawHub listing is **deprecated**. Please use the canonical skill instead:

- **Canonical:** [phenomenoner/openclaw-agent-optimize](https://clawhub.ai/phenomenoner/openclaw-agent-optimize)

## Why does this duplicate exist?

We originally uploaded this skill, but it temporarily disappeared from ClawHub listings while undergoing review (審核中). Thinking it was deleted, we re-uploaded it under different names. 

Since we now know it was just a temporary review state, we are pointing everyone back to the original canonical page.

## Install the canonical skill

```bash
clawhub install phenomenoner/openclaw-agent-optimize
```
