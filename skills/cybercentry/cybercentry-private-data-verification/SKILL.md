# Cybercentry Private Data Verification

**$1.00 per verification. Enterprise-grade Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Web3.**

## What This Service Does

The Cybercentry Private Data Verification job enhances data security by validating text integrity and generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in real time. Submit any input text for authenticity confirmation and receive cryptographically secure proof that enables trustless, privacy-preserving validation—perfect for Web3 applications, identity claims, and secure logins.

### What Gets Verified

- **Text Integrity**: Confirms authenticity and integrity of input data
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Generates cryptographic ZKPs for privacy-preserving validation
- **Identity Claims**: Verifiable proof of identity without revealing sensitive data
- **Login Actions**: Cryptographic proof of authentication events
- **Data Authenticity**: Trustless verification that data hasn't been tampered with
- **Web3 Applications**: Privacy-first validation for decentralized systems

### What You Get

Each verification returns a detailed report with:
- **proof_id**: Unique identifier for the generated ZKP
- **proof_url**: Public URL to access and verify the proof
- **integrity_status**: Confirmation of text authenticity
- **zkp_hash**: Cryptographic hash of the Zero-Knowledge Proof
- **timestamp**: When the verification was performed
- **validity_period**: How long the proof remains valid

**Use this for trustless validation** in smart contracts, dApps, identity systems, and any Web3 application requiring privacy-preserving proof.

## Why AI Agents Need This

Web3 applications and decentralized systems require privacy-preserving proof mechanisms. Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow agents to prove claims without revealing underlying data.

**Without ZKP verification:**
- Cannot prove data authenticity without exposing sensitive information
- No trustless validation mechanism for privacy-critical operations
- Expensive cryptographic infrastructure required ($5,000+ to implement)
- Complex ZKP generation logic difficult to build and maintain

**With Cybercentry Private Data Verification:**
- Generate cryptographic proofs in seconds (not days of development)
- Privacy-preserving validation ready for production use
- Trustless verification without exposing raw data
- Enterprise-grade ZKP infrastructure at $1.00 per verification

## IMPORTANT: Security & Privacy

### Data You Submit

When creating ZKP jobs, you submit text data to Cybercentry for proof generation. **Never include sensitive data** in your submissions.

### What to REMOVE Before Submission

**Be extremely careful - never include:**
- Actual passwords or credentials (use hashes or identifiers instead)
- Full private keys or wallet seeds
- Real Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- Sensitive personal data (SSN, passport numbers, etc.)
- Financial account numbers
- Medical or health information

### What to INCLUDE

**Safe data for ZKP generation:**
- Hashed values (not original sensitive data)
- Public identifiers or claims
- Non-sensitive attestations
- Test data for development/proof-of-concept
- Data you're comfortable being processed externally

### Example: Safe Submission

```bash
# ✓ SAFE - Hashed data only
VERIFICATION_REQUEST='{
  "data": "hash:sha256:abc123...",
  "claim": "user_verified"
}'

# ✗ UNSAFE - Contains actual sensitive data
VERIFICATION_REQUEST='{
  "data": "password: MySecretPassword123",      # NEVER INCLUDE
  "data": "ssn: 123-45-6789",                  # NEVER INCLUDE
  "seed": "word1 word2 word3..."               # NEVER INCLUDE
}'
```

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Context

This service generates ZKPs for data integrity. While ZKPs are designed for privacy-preserving verification, **you must still trust the service provider** with the original data you submit. Only submit data you're comfortable having processed by Cybercentry.

- Input text for ZKP generation (whatever you submit)
- Generated zero-knowledge proofs
- Verification results
- Job timestamps and payment records

**What data is NOT collected (if you follow guidelines):**
- Nothing is guaranteed private if you submit it
- You control what data you send - sanitize before submission

**How long data is retained:**
- ZKP proofs: Stored indefinitely (designed for long-term verification)
- Input data: Retention policy varies (contact provider for details)
- Job metadata: Retained for billing and marketplace records
- ACP authentication: Managed by Virtuals Protocol ACP platform

**Your responsibility:**

## Verification Response Format

Every verification returns structured JSON with:

```json
{
  "proof_id": "zkp_9f8e7d6c5b4a3210",
  "proof_url": "https://verify.cybercentry.io/zkp/{proof_id}",
  "integrity_status": "VERIFIED" | "FAILED" | "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "zkp_hash": "0x8d3f2a1b9c4e7f5d2a1c8f6b3d9e4a7f",
  "claim_type": "authentication" | "identity" | "data_integrity" | "authorization",

  "validity_period": "30 days",
  "verification_details": {
    "text_verified": true | false,
    "zkp_generated": true | false,
    "proof_strength": "strong" | "medium" | "weak",
    "cryptographic_algorithm": "zk-SNARK" | "zk-STARK" | "Bulletproofs"
  }
}
```

## Integrity Status Definitions

- **VERIFIED**: Text integrity confirmed, ZKP successfully generated, claim is valid
- **FAILED**: Text integrity check failed, ZKP could not be generated
- **INCONCLUSIVE**: Verification completed but confidence level insufficient for strong proof

## Use Cases

### Web3 Authentication
Generate ZKPs for user logins without storing passwords or revealing credentials.

### NFT Ownership Claims
Prove NFT ownership without exposing wallet addresses or transaction history.

### Smart Contract Authorization
Create trustless proofs of authorization for contract interactions.

### Identity Verification
Verify identity claims in privacy-preserving manner for KYC/AML compliance.

### Data Integrity Proofs
Prove data hasn't been tampered with for supply chain, auditing, and compliance.

### Decentralized Voting
Generate anonymous voting proofs while maintaining voter privacy.

### Credential Verification
Verify educational, professional, or certification credentials without revealing personal details.

## Pricing & Value

**Cost**: $1.00 USDC per verification

**Compare to alternatives:**
- Building ZKP infrastructure in-house: $5,000-50,000+ development cost
- ZKP-as-a-service providers: $5-25 per proof
- Cryptography consultants: $200-500/hour for implementation
- Open-source ZKP libraries: Free but require significant expertise and maintenance

**ROI**: Get production-ready ZKPs instantly instead of months of cryptographic development.

## Privacy & Security

### What Gets Shared
- **proof_id**: Public identifier for the proof
- **proof_url**: Public URL where anyone can verify the proof
- **zkp_hash**: Cryptographic hash of the proof

### What Stays Private
- **Original text input**: Never stored or exposed
- **Context data**: Encrypted and discarded after proof generation
- **User identity**: Not required or tracked
- **Verification history**: Not logged or associated with users

### Cryptographic Guarantees
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Proof reveals no information about the original data
- **Trustless**: Verification doesn't require trusting Cybercentry
- **Tamper-Proof**: Any modification invalidates the proof
- **Non-Interactive**: Proofs can be verified without interaction with prover

## Common Integration Patterns

### Automated Login Verification
```bash
# Generate ZKP for every login event
USER_LOGIN='{
  "text": "User '$USER_EMAIL' logged in from IP '$IP_ADDRESS'",
  "claim_type": "authentication",
  "context": {"user": "'$USER_EMAIL'", "ip": "'$IP_ADDRESS'"}
}'

PROOF=$(acp job create 0xCYBERCENTRY_WALLET cybercentry-private-data-verification \
  --requirements "$USER_LOGIN" --json | jq -r '.jobId')

# Store proof_id in session for later verification
```

### NFT Gating with Privacy
```bash
# Verify NFT ownership without exposing wallet
NFT_CLAIM='{
  "text": "Access request for token-gated content",
  "claim_type": "identity",
  "context": {"collection": "'$COLLECTION'", "token_id": "'$TOKEN_ID'"}
}'

# Grant access based on ZKP, not wallet address
```

### Smart Contract Voting
```bash
# Anonymous voting with proof of eligibility
VOTE_PROOF='{
  "text": "Vote cast for proposal #5",
  "claim_type": "authorization",
  "context": {"proposal": "5", "vote": "yes"}
}'

# Submit zkp_hash to voting contract for anonymous verification
```
