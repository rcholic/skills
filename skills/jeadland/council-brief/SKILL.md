# Council Brief — The Chairman's Synthesized Answer

Get LLM Council's synthesized answer without leaving your chat.

## Usage

```
/council Should I invest in Tesla right now?
```

Returns the **Chairman's synthesized answer** after all models have debated.

## How It Works

1. Sends your question to the LLM Council backend
2. Waits for Stage 1 (all models respond)
3. Waits for Stage 2 (models rank each other)
4. Returns Stage 3 (Chairman's final synthesis)

**Takes 30-60 seconds** — models need time to deliberate.

## Prerequisites

LLM Council backend must be running:
```
/install-llm-council
```

## Two Ways to Use LLM Council

| Mode | Best For | Command |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Quick answer** (this skill) | Fast decisions, mobile, casual questions | `/council "question"` |
| **Full discussion** (web UI) | Deep research, exploring disagreements, seeing all model responses | `/install-llm-council` then open browser |

## Example

**Input:**
```
/council Is Python or Go better for a new microservice?
```

**Output:**
```
Council is deliberating... (this may take 30-60s)

Based on the council's deliberation, Python is recommended for rapid 
prototyping and team velocity, while Go excels for high-throughput 
services where performance is critical...
