description: Controllable image generation and editing with Bria.ai commercially-safe AI models. Fine-grained control over what gets generated, edited, or removed — edit by text instruction, mask specific regions, add/replace/remove individual objects, control lighting, season, and style independently. Use this skill when building websites, apps, presentations, or documents that need product photos, hero images, icons, illustrations, or backgrounds. Also use for e-commerce product photography, background removal, image upscaling, style transfer, batch generation, and pipeline workflows (generate -> edit -> remove background). Triggers on tasks involving AI image generation, controllable image editing, background removal, or visual asset creation.

# Bria — Controllable Image Generation & Editing

Generate and precisely control visual assets using Bria's commercially-safe AI models (FIBO, RMBG-2.0, GenFill, and more). Unlike black-box generators, Bria gives you fine-grained control: edit by text instruction, mask specific regions, add/replace/remove individual objects, change lighting or season independently, and chain operations in pipelines.

## Setup — API Key Check

Before making any Bria API call, check for the API key and help the user set it up if missing:

### Step 1: Check if the key exists

```bash
echo $BRIA_API_KEY
```

If the output is **not empty**, skip to the next section.

### Step 2: If the key is missing, guide the user

Open the Bria API keys page in the browser:

```bash
open "https://platform.bria.ai/console/account/api-keys?utm_source=skill&utm_campaign=bria_skills&utm_content=adjust_photoshop_for_agent"   # macOS
# xdg-open "https://platform.bria.ai/console/account/api-keys?utm_source=skill&utm_campaign=bria_skills&utm_content=adjust_photoshop_for_agent"  # Linux
```

Then tell the user exactly this:
> I opened the Bria website in your browser. To use image generation, you need a free API key.
>
> 1. Sign up or log in on the page I just opened
> 2. Click **Create API Key**
> 3. Copy the key and **paste it here**

Wait for the user to provide their API key. Do not proceed until they give you the key.

### Step 3: Save the key permanently

Once the user provides the key, save it so it persists across sessions.

**On macOS/Linux**, detect the shell and append to the correct profile:

```bash
# Detect the shell profile
if [ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ] || [ "$SHELL" = */zsh ]; then
  PROFILE_FILE="$HOME/.zshrc"
elif [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
  PROFILE_FILE="$HOME/.bashrc"
else
  PROFILE_FILE="$HOME/.profile"
fi

# Append the export (only if not already present)
grep -q 'export BRIA_API_KEY=' "$PROFILE_FILE" 2>/dev/null && \
  sed -i.bak '/export BRIA_API_KEY=/d' "$PROFILE_FILE"
echo 'export BRIA_API_KEY="THE_KEY_THE_USER_GAVE_YOU"' >> "$PROFILE_FILE"

# Make it available immediately in this session
export BRIA_API_KEY="THE_KEY_THE_USER_GAVE_YOU"
```

**On Windows (PowerShell)**:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("BRIA_API_KEY", "THE_KEY_THE_USER_GAVE_YOU", "User")
$env:BRIA_API_KEY = "THE_KEY_THE_USER_GAVE_YOU"
```

Replace `THE_KEY_THE_USER_GAVE_YOU` with the actual key the user provided.

### Step 4: Verify

```bash
echo $BRIA_API_KEY
```

Confirm the key is set, then tell the user:
> Your API key is saved and will persist across sessions. You're all set!

**Do not proceed with any image generation or editing until the API key is confirmed set.**

## Quick Reference

### Generate an Image (FIBO)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/image/generate" \
  -H "api_token: $BRIA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "your description",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
  }'
```

**Aspect ratios**: `1:1` (square), `16:9` (hero/banner), `4:3` (presentation), `9:16` (mobile/story), `3:4` (portrait)

> **Advanced**: For precise, deterministic control over generation, use **[VGL structured prompts](../vgl/SKILL.md)** instead of natural language. VGL defines every visual attribute (objects, lighting, composition) as explicit JSON.

### Remove Background (RMBG-2.0)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/image/edit/remove_background" \
  -H "api_token: $BRIA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"image": "https://..."}'
```

Returns PNG with transparency.

### Edit Image (FIBO-Edit) - No Mask Required

```bash
curl -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/image/edit" \
  -H "api_token: $BRIA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "images": ["https://..."],
    "instruction": "change the mug to red"
  }'
```

### Edit Image Region with Mask (GenFill)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/image/edit/gen_fill" \
  -H "api_token: $BRIA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image": "https://...",
    "mask": "https://...",
    "prompt": "what to generate in masked area"
  }'
```

### Expand Image (Outpainting)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/image/edit/expand" \
  -H "api_token: $BRIA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image": "base64-or-url",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "prompt": "coffee shop background, wooden table"
  }'
```

### Upscale Image

```bash
curl -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/image/edit/increase_resolution" \
  -H "api_token: $BRIA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"image": "https://...", "scale": 2}'
```

### Product Lifestyle Shot

```bash
curl -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/image/edit/lifestyle_shot_by_text" \
  -H "api_token: $BRIA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image": "https://product-with-transparent-bg.png",
    "prompt": "modern kitchen countertop, natural morning light"
  }'
```

## Async Response Handling

All endpoints return async responses:

```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "status_url": "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/status/uuid"
}
```

Poll the status_url until `status: "COMPLETED"`, then get `result.image_url`.

```python
import requests, time

def get_result(status_url, api_key):
    while True:
        r = requests.get(status_url, headers={"api_token": api_key})
        data = r.json()
        if data["status"] == "COMPLETED":
            return data["result"]["image_url"]
        if data["status"] == "FAILED":
            raise Exception(data.get("error"))
        time.sleep(2)
```

## Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Style**: "professional product photography" vs "casual snapshot", "flat design illustration" vs "3D rendered"
- **Lighting**: "soft natural light", "studio lighting", "dramatic shadows"
- **Background**: "white studio", "gradient", "blurred office", "transparent"
- **Composition**: "centered", "rule of thirds", "negative space on left for text"
- **Quality keywords**: "high quality", "professional", "commercial grade", "4K", "sharp focus"
- **Negative prompts**: "blurry, low quality, pixelated", "text, watermark, logo"
