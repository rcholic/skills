# Agent Self-Governance

Four protocols that prevent agent failure modes: losing context, false completion claims, persona drift, and wasteful spending.

## 1. WAL (Write-Ahead Log)

**Rule: Write before you respond.** If something is worth remembering, WAL it first.

| Trigger | Action Type | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| User corrects you | `correction` | "No, use Podman not Docker" |
| Key decision | `decision` | "Using CogVideoX-2B for text-to-video" |
| Important analysis | `analysis` | "WAL patterns should be core infra not skills" |
| State change | `state_change` | "GPU server SSH key auth configured" |

```bash
# Write before responding
python3 scripts/wal.py append <agent_id> correction "Use Podman not Docker"

# Working buffer (batch, flush before compaction)
python3 scripts/wal.py buffer-add <agent_id> decision "Some decision"
python3 scripts/wal.py flush-buffer <agent_id>

# Session start: replay lost context
python3 scripts/wal.py replay <agent_id>

# After incorporating a replayed entry
python3 scripts/wal.py mark-applied <agent_id> <entry_id>

# Maintenance
python3 scripts/wal.py status <agent_id>
python3 scripts/wal.py prune <agent_id> --keep 50
```

### Integration Points
- **Session start** → `replay` to recover lost context
- **User correction** → `append` BEFORE responding
- **Pre-compaction flush** → `flush-buffer` then write daily memory
- **During conversation** → `buffer-add` for less critical items

## 2. VBR (Verify Before Reporting)

**Rule: Don't say "done" until verified.** Run a check before claiming completion.

```bash
# Verify a file exists
python3 scripts/vbr.py check task123 file_exists /path/to/output.py

# Verify a file was recently modified
python3 scripts/vbr.py check task123 file_changed /path/to/file.go

# Verify a command succeeds
python3 scripts/vbr.py check task123 command "cd /tmp/repo && go test ./..."

# Verify git is pushed
python3 scripts/vbr.py check task123 git_pushed /tmp/repo

# Log verification result
python3 scripts/vbr.py log <agent_id> task123 true "All tests pass"

# View pass/fail stats
python3 scripts/vbr.py stats <agent_id>
```

### When to VBR
- After code changes → `check command "go test ./..."`
- After file creation → `check file_exists /path`
- After git push → `check git_pushed /repo`
- After sub-agent task → verify the claimed output exists

## 3. ADL (Anti-Divergence Limit)

**Rule: Stay true to your persona.** Track behavioral drift from SOUL.md.

```bash
# Analyze a response for anti-patterns
python3 scripts/adl.py analyze "Great question! I'd be happy to help you with that!"

# Log a behavioral observation
python3 scripts/adl.py log <agent_id> anti_sycophancy "Used 'Great question!' in response"
python3 scripts/adl.py log <agent_id> persona_direct "Shipped fix without asking permission"

# Calculate divergence score (0=aligned, 1=fully drifted)
python3 scripts/adl.py score <agent_id>

# Check against threshold
python3 scripts/adl.py check <agent_id> --threshold 0.7

# Reset after recalibration
python3 scripts/adl.py reset <agent_id>
```

### Anti-Patterns Tracked
- **Sycophancy** — "Great question!", "I'd be happy to help!"
- **Passivity** — "Would you like me to", "Shall I", "Let me know if"
- **Hedging** — "I think maybe", "It might be possible"
- **Verbosity** — Response length exceeding expected bounds

### Persona Signals (Positive)
- **Direct** — "Done", "Fixed", "Ship", "Built"
- **Opinionated** — "I'd argue", "Better to", "The right call"
- **Action-oriented** — "Spawning", "On it", "Kicking off"

## 4. VFM (Value-For-Money)

**Rule: Track cost vs value.** Don't burn premium tokens on budget tasks.

```bash
# Log a completed task with cost
python3 scripts/vfm.py log <agent_id> monitoring glm-4.7 37000 0.03 0.8

# Calculate VFM scores
python3 scripts/vfm.py score <agent_id>

# Cost breakdown by model and task
python3 scripts/vfm.py report <agent_id>

# Get optimization suggestions
python3 scripts/vfm.py suggest <agent_id>
```

### Task → Tier Guidelines
| Task Type | Recommended Tier | Models |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Monitoring, formatting, summarization | Budget | GLM, DeepSeek, Haiku |
| Code generation, debugging, creative | Standard | Sonnet, Gemini Pro |
| Architecture, complex analysis | Premium | Opus, Sonnet+thinking |

### When to Check VFM
- After spawning sub-agents → log cost and outcome
- During heartbeat → run `suggest` for optimization tips
- Weekly review → run `report` for cost breakdown
