# Proactive Tasks

A task management system that transforms reactive assistants into proactive partners who work autonomously on shared goals.

## Core Concept

Instead of waiting for your human to tell you what to do, this skill lets you:
- Track goals and break them into actionable tasks
- Work on tasks during heartbeats
- Message your human with updates and ask for input when blocked
- Make steady progress on long-term objectives

## Quick Start

### Creating Goals

When your human mentions a goal or project:

```bash
python3 scripts/task_manager.py add-goal "Build voice assistant hardware" \
  --priority high \
  --context "Replace Alexa with custom solution using local models"
```

### Breaking Down into Tasks

```bash
python3 scripts/task_manager.py add-task "Build voice assistant hardware" \
  "Research voice-to-text models" \
  --priority high

python3 scripts/task_manager.py add-task "Build voice assistant hardware" \
  "Compare Raspberry Pi vs other hardware options" \
  --depends-on "Research voice-to-text models"
```

### During Heartbeats

Check what to work on next:

```bash
python3 scripts/task_manager.py next-task
```

This returns the highest-priority task you can work on (no unmet dependencies, not blocked).

### Completing Tasks

```bash
python3 scripts/task_manager.py complete-task <task-id> \
  --notes "Researched Whisper, Coqui, vosk. Whisper.cpp looks best for Pi."
```

### Messaging Your Human

When you complete something important or get blocked:

```bash
python3 scripts/task_manager.py mark-needs-input <task-id> \
  --reason "Need budget approval for hardware purchase"
```

Then message your human with the update/question.

## Task States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `pending` | Ready to work on (all dependencies met) |
| `in_progress` | Currently working on it |
| `blocked` | Can't proceed (dependencies not met) |
| `needs_input` | Waiting for human input/decision |
| `completed` | Done! |
| `cancelled` | No longer relevant |

## Heartbeat Integration

To enable autonomous proactive work, you need to set up a heartbeat system. This tells you to periodically check for tasks and work on them.

**Quick setup:** See [HEARTBEAT_SETUP.md](references/HEARTBEAT_SETUP.md) for complete step-by-step instructions.

**TL;DR:**
1. Create a cron job that sends you a heartbeat message every 30 minutes
2. Add proactive-tasks checks to your `HEARTBEAT.md`
3. You'll automatically check for tasks and work on them without waiting for prompts

### Heartbeat Message Template

Your cron job should send this message every 30 minutes:

```
💓 Heartbeat check: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
```

### Add to HEARTBEAT.md

Add this to your workspace `HEARTBEAT.md`:

```markdown
## Proactive Tasks (Every heartbeat) 🚀

Check if there's work to do on our goals:

- [ ] Run `python3 skills/proactive-tasks/scripts/task_manager.py next-task`
- [ ] If a task is returned, work on it for up to 10-15 minutes
- [ ] Update task status when done, blocked, or needs input
- [ ] Message your human with meaningful updates (completions, blockers, discoveries)
- [ ] Don't spam - only message for significant milestones or when stuck

**Goal:** Make autonomous progress on our shared objectives without waiting for prompts.
```

### What Happens

```
Every 30 minutes:
├─ Heartbeat fires
├─ You read HEARTBEAT.md
├─ Check for next task
├─ If task found → work on it, update status, message human if needed
└─ If nothing → reply "HEARTBEAT_OK" (silent)
```

**The transformation:** You go from reactive (waiting for prompts) to proactive (making steady autonomous progress).

## Best Practices

### When to Create Goals

- Long-term projects (building something, learning a topic)
- Recurring responsibilities (monitor X, maintain Y)
- Exploratory work (research Z, evaluate options for W)

### When to Create Tasks

Break goals into tasks that are:
- **Specific**: "Research Whisper models" not "Look into AI stuff"
- **Achievable in one sitting**: 15-60 minutes of focused work
- **Clear completion criteria**: You know when it's done

### When to Message Your Human

✅ **Do message when:**
- You complete a meaningful milestone
- You need input/decision to proceed
- You discover something important
- A task will take longer than expected

❌ **Don't spam with:**
- Every tiny sub-task completion
- Routine progress updates
- Things they didn't ask about (unless relevant)

### Managing Scope Creep

If a task turns out to be bigger than expected:
1. Mark current task as `in_progress`
2. Add new sub-tasks for the pieces you discovered
3. Update dependencies
4. Continue with manageable chunks

## File Structure

All data stored in `data/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "goals": [
    {
      "id": "goal_001",
      "title": "Build voice assistant hardware",
      "priority": "high",
      "context": "Replace Alexa with custom solution",
      "created_at": "2026-02-05T05:25:00Z",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task_001",
      "goal_id": "goal_001",
      "title": "Research voice-to-text models",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "completed",
      "created_at": "2026-02-05T05:26:00Z",
      "completed_at": "2026-02-05T06:15:00Z",
      "notes": "Researched Whisper, Coqui, vosk. Whisper.cpp best for Pi."
    }
  ]
}
```

## CLI Reference

See [CLI_REFERENCE.md](references/CLI_REFERENCE.md) for complete command documentation.

## Example Workflow

**Day 1:**
```
Human: "Let's build a custom voice assistant to replace Alexa"
Agent: *Creates goal, breaks into initial research tasks*
```

**During heartbeat:**
```bash
$ python3 scripts/task_manager.py next-task
→ task_001: Research voice-to-text models (priority: high)

# Agent works on it, completes research
$ python3 scripts/task_manager.py complete-task task_001 --notes "..."
```

**Agent messages human:**
> "Hey! I finished researching voice models. Whisper.cpp looks perfect for Raspberry Pi - runs locally, good accuracy, low latency. Want me to compare hardware options next?"

**Day 2:**
```
Human: "Yeah, compare Pi 5 vs alternatives"
Agent: *Adds task, works on it during next heartbeat*
```

This cycle continues - the agent makes steady autonomous progress while keeping the human in the loop for decisions and updates.
