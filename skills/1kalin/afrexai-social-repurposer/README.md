# Content Repurposer

One piece of content → 10+ formats. Stop creating from scratch when you can multiply what you already have.

## What It Does

Give it a blog post, podcast transcript, video script, or even raw notes, and get back:

1. **Twitter/X thread** — hook-first, standalone tweets
2. **LinkedIn post** — storytelling format
3. **Instagram carousel** — slide-by-slide text
4. **Newsletter snippet** — with subject line
5. **Short-form video script** — 60-90 second TikTok/Reel
6. **Blog post outline** — with SEO angle
7. **Quote graphics** — 5 shareable one-liners
8. **Email sequence** — 3-part nurture series
9. **Podcast talking points** — discussion-ready
10. **YouTube description** — SEO-optimized with timestamps

## Example Usage

> "Repurpose this blog post into all 10 formats: [paste article]"

> "Turn my podcast transcript into Twitter threads and LinkedIn posts"

> "I have these raw notes from a talk — make them into content for every platform"

## Who It's For

Content creators, marketers, founders building in public — anyone who wants 10x output from every idea without 10x the effort.
