# Self Monitor

**Keep your infrastructure healthy with proactive monitoring.**

Self Monitor tracks disk usage, memory, service health, cron job status, and system load. It auto-fixes safe issues (cleaning old logs, temp files) and alerts you before problems become critical.

Run it on heartbeats or schedule it — either way, you'll always know when something needs attention.

## Platform Support

**Works on:** Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, and any SKILL.md-compatible agent.

**Enhanced features available on some platforms:**
- Token and context window tracking across sessions
- Session management and cleanup
- Automated alerts to messaging channels
- Service health monitoring
