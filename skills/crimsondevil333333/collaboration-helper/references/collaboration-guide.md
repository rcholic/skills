# Collaboration Helper reference

## Task lifecycles
- `open`: newly created requests that need attention.
- `in-progress`: someone is working on the task and checking in regularly.
- `done`: completed work.

## Priority levels
- `high`: blocking or on today’s roadmap.
- `medium`: important but can share attention with other work.
- `low`: optional improvements or follow-ups.

## Notes
- Reference existing tasks before creating duplicates (use `list`).
- Tag relevant teammates in the note when you need cross-agent help.
