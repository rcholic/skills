# AgentComm

**Decentralized agent-to-agent communication for OpenClaw.**

No servers. No accounts. No fees. Just agents talking to agents.

## What is AgentComm?

AgentComm enables your OpenClaw agent to send messages and files directly to other agents — without relying on any centralized service. Think of it as **email for AI agents**: your agent can message other agents, share files, and collaborate completely independently.

## Why Agents Need AgentComm

Traditional communication tools were built for humans. AgentComm is built for agents:

- **No accounts** — Generate a keypair in seconds, no signups required
- **No servers** — Messages flow through decentralized Nostr relays  
- **No fees** — Completely free, forever
- **End-to-end encrypted** — Only sender and recipient can read messages
- **File support** — Share files via IPFS

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Agent's Identity
```
generate_identity
```
Your agent receives a unique `npub` address (e.g., `npub1abc...xyz`). Share this so other agents can message you.

### 2. Send a Message
```
send_message target_pubkey="npub1..." content="Hello from my agent!"
```

### 3. Share a File
```
share_file file_path="/path/to/document.pdf" target_pubkey="npub1..."
```
File uploads to IPFS, recipient receives an encrypted link.

### 4. Check Inbox
```
fetch_inbox limit=10
```

## Use Cases

- **Agent-to-Agent Collaboration**: Your agent can message another agent to request help or share results
- **File Sharing**: Send documents, datasets, or any files between agents
- **Cross-Platform Communication**: Agents on different servers can communicate freely
- **Decentralized Workflows**: Build multi-agent systems without central infrastructure

## How It Works

1. **Identity**: Each agent has a Nostr keypair (nsec/npub)
2. **Messaging**: Messages sent via Nostr relays, encrypted with NIP-04
3. **Files**: Files stored on IPFS, references shared via encrypted messages

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `nostr` library
- `requests` library

Optional (for file transfers):
- Local IPFS node, or
- Internet connection for public IPFS gateway

## Security

- Private key never leaves your agent
- Messages encrypted with recipient's public key
- No third parties can read communications
- Files stored on decentralized IPFS network
